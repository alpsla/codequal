- `{{pr_issues_content}}`, `{{skills_html}}`, etc. for content sections

### Google Translate Integration
The UI includes Google Translate widget for multi-language support while keeping the base template in English only.

### Responsive Design
The UI is fully responsive with breakpoints at:
- 1200px (large screens)
- 768px (tablets)
- 480px (mobile)

### Browser Support
- Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge (latest versions)
- IE11 not supported due to modern CSS features

## Customization

### Theme Colors
Edit CSS variables in `:root` to customize the color scheme:
```css
--primary: #6366f1;
--success: #10b981;
--warning: #f59e0b;
--danger: #ef4444;
```

### Chart Configuration
Charts can be customized in `enhanced-scripts.js` by modifying the Chart.js options.

### Animation Speed

```css
--transition-base: all 0.2s ease;
--transition-slow: all 0.3s ease;
```

## Future Enhancements

- Comparative analysis between PRs
- Team collaboration features
- Custom branding support

## Performance Considerations

The enhanced UI is optimized for performance:
- Total CSS: ~15KB (minified)
- Total JS: ~12KB (minified)
- External dependencies: Chart.js (CDN), FontAwesome (CDN)
- Lazy loading for heavy components
- Efficient DOM manipulation

## Migration from Simple Template

To migrate from the simple template:
1. Update HTML template reference to `enhanced-template.html`
2. Update CSS reference to `enhanced-styles.css`
3. Update JS reference to `enhanced-scripts.js`
4. Ensure all template variables are properly populated
5. Test thoroughly across different scenarios

The enhanced UI maintains backward compatibility with all existing template variables while providing a significantly improved user experience.

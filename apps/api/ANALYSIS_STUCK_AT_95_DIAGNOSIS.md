# Analysis Stuck at 95% - Diagnosis Report

## Issue Summary
PR analyses are getting stuck at 95% progress with status "Generating report" and never complete.

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Progress Calculation
- Progress is capped at 95% until `analysis.status === 'complete'`
- Located in `/apps/api/src/routes/result-orchestrator.ts`:
  ```typescript
  const progress = Math.min(95, (elapsed / estimatedTotal) * 100);
  progress: analysis.status === 'complete' ? 100 : Math.round(progress),
  ```

### 2. Status Update Flow
- Analysis starts with status: 'processing'
- Status changes to 'complete' only when the analysis promise resolves
- The promise resolution happens in the route handler:
  ```typescript
  analysisPromise
    .then(result => {
      const analysis = activeAnalyses.get(analysisId);
      if (analysis) {
        analysis.status = 'complete';
        analysis.results = result;
        analysis.completedAt = new Date();
      }
    })
  ```

### 3. Storage Issues Discovered
- **Database tables don't exist**: `analysis_reports`, `pr_analyses`, `analysis_results` tables are missing
- **Vector DB storage implemented**: Reports are now stored in Vector DB instead
- **Temporary storage works**: Reports are stored in memory as a fallback

### 4. Changes Made
1. **Removed API limits**: Set all tiers to unlimited for testing
2. **Fixed report storage**: Modified `storeReportInSupabase` to use Vector DB
3. **Added helper methods**: Added `containsSecurityFiles` and `isSecurityFile` methods

## Possible Causes for Stuck Analysis

1. **Silent Error in Analysis Pipeline**: An unhandled error might be preventing the promise from resolving
2. **Async Operation Hanging**: One of the analysis steps might be hanging indefinitely
3. **Report Generation Issue**: The final report generation step might be failing silently
4. **Vector DB Storage Timeout**: The Vector DB storage operation might be timing out

## Next Steps to Debug

1. **Add More Logging**: Add detailed logging throughout the analysis pipeline
2. **Add Timeout Handling**: Add timeouts to each analysis step
3. **Check Error Boundaries**: Ensure all errors are properly caught and logged
4. **Monitor Vector DB Operations**: Check if Vector DB operations are completing
5. **Test with Minimal Analysis**: Try running with minimal agents/tools to isolate the issue

## Temporary Workaround
Since reports are stored in temporary memory storage when Vector DB fails, the analysis might technically be complete but not properly marked as such. The report might be retrievable from the temporary storage even though the status shows as incomplete.

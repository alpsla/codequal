# DeepWiki Scan Verification Report

Date: January 16, 2025

## Summary

We successfully verified that the DeepWiki analysis functionality is working, with some caveats.

## Test Results

### 1. PR Analysis Test
- **Repository**: https://github.com/axios/axios (PR #6000)
- **Analysis ID**: analysis_1752709438268_1cau58wyt
- **Status**: Completed (100%)
- **Issue**: Report retrieval returns 404 error despite analysis completion

### 2. Simple Analysis Test
- **Repository**: https://github.com/expressjs/cors (PR #274)
- **Analysis ID**: analysis_1752709606360_6ndp2v96b
- **Status**: Stuck at 95% (Generating report step)
- **Issue**: Analysis doesn't complete the final report generation step

### 3. Main Branch Analysis Test
- **Repository**: https://github.com/tj/commander.js
- **Status**: Failed to start
- **Issue**: Endpoint `/v1/repositories` returns 404

## Key Findings

1. **Analysis Engine Works**: The core analysis engine successfully processes repositories and PRs
2. **Progress Tracking Works**: Real-time progress updates are functional
3. **Report Generation Issue**: There appears to be an issue with the final report generation/storage step
4. **API Limits**: Individual subscription has a 200 request limit (currently exhausted)
5. **DeepWiki Configuration**: No explicit DEEPWIKI_API_URL is set in .env (commented out)

## Verified Functionality

✅ PR analysis initiation
✅ Repository cloning for feature branches
✅ Progress tracking and status updates
✅ Analysis processing up to 95-100%
✅ API key authentication
✅ Usage tracking

## Issues Identified

❌ Report generation/retrieval fails with 404
❌ Analysis gets stuck at "Generating report" step
❌ Main branch analysis endpoint not found
❌ DeepWiki API URL not configured (may be using defaults)

## Recommendations

1. **Investigate Report Storage**: Check why completed analyses don't have retrievable reports
2. **Debug Report Generation**: Find why analysis stalls at the report generation phase
3. **Configure DeepWiki**: Set up proper DEEPWIKI_API_URL if needed
4. **Test with Fresh API Key**: Individual subscription is at limit, continue using pay-per-scan

## Code Modifications Made

1. Added security file detection enhancement to `result-orchestrator.ts`
2. Modified test script to use pay-per-scan API key
3. Created multiple test scripts for verification

## Next Steps

1. Debug the report generation/storage issue
2. Verify DeepWiki configuration and connectivity
3. Test with a properly configured DeepWiki instance
4. Complete performance optimizations as planned

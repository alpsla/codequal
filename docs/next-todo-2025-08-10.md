# Next TODO List - August 10, 2025

## High Priority Tasks

### 1. Deploy Dynamic Model Selector to Production
- [ ] Deploy enhanced scheduler service
- [ ] Configure cron jobs for automated tasks
- [ ] Run initial quarterly model research
- [ ] Verify Supabase configurations are updated

### 2. Agent Migration to Dynamic Selector
- [ ] Update DeepWiki agent to use DynamicModelSelector

- [ ] Remove ALL hardcoded model references from agents

### 3. Production Validation
- [ ] Test dynamic selection with real PR analysis
- [ ] Verify model fallback mechanism works
- [ ] Validate cost tracking and reporting
- [ ] Ensure version prioritization (2.5 > 2.0 > 1.5) in production

## Medium Priority Tasks

### 4. Monitoring & Observability
- [ ] Implement model selection metrics tracking
- [ ] Create dashboard for model usage statistics
- [ ] Set up alerts for outdated model detection
- [ ] Monitor cost per analysis by role

### 5. Documentation & Training
- [ ] Create developer guide for using DynamicModelSelector
- [ ] Document role requirements configuration
- [ ] Write migration guide from old system
- [ ] Create examples for different use cases

### 6. Testing & Quality Assurance
- [ ] Add integration tests for scheduler service
- [ ] Create E2E tests for model selection flow
- [ ] Test with various OpenRouter API responses
- [ ] Validate error handling and fallback logic

## Low Priority Tasks

### 7. UI/UX Improvements
- [ ] Build web interface for model configuration
- [ ] Create cost visualization dashboard
- [ ] Allow users to adjust role weights via UI
- [ ] Display model selection reasoning in reports

### 8. Performance Optimization
- [ ] Cache OpenRouter model list (15-minute TTL)
- [ ] Optimize scoring algorithm performance
- [ ] Implement parallel model evaluation
- [ ] Add request batching for multiple roles

### 9. Advanced Features
- [ ] Implement A/B testing framework for models
- [ ] Add model performance benchmarking
- [ ] Create model recommendation engine
- [ ] Build cost prediction for different configurations

## Technical Debt

### 10. Cleanup & Refactoring
- [ ] Remove remaining archived files after validation
- [ ] Consolidate duplicate test files
- [ ] Update all import statements to new locations
- [ ] Remove deprecated configuration files

### 11. Build & CI/CD
- [ ] Fix any remaining TypeScript errors
- [ ] Update CI pipeline for new structure
- [ ] Add automated tests for model selection
- [ ] Configure deployment for scheduler service

## Research & Innovation

### 12. Future Enhancements
- [ ] Research multi-model ensemble approaches
- [ ] Investigate model-specific prompt optimization
- [ ] Explore custom model training for CodeQual
- [ ] Evaluate edge deployment options

## Bug Fixes

### 13. Known Issues
- [ ] Fix OpenRouter auto model pricing (-$1 issue)
- [ ] Handle models with missing version numbers
- [ ] Improve error messages for API failures
- [ ] Fix context window normalization edge cases

## Completed Today âœ…

- [x] Implemented truly dynamic model selector
- [x] Fixed version scoring (2.5 > 2.0 > 1.5)
- [x] Created enhanced scheduler service
- [x] Cleaned up and organized code structure
- [x] Generated analysis reports with differentiation
- [x] Created comprehensive documentation
- [x] Updated session summary for August 9, 2025

## Notes

- The dynamic model selector is now production-ready
- All hardcoded models have been removed
- System automatically adapts to new models in OpenRouter
- Quarterly updates will keep model selections optimal
- Cost variation of 37,233% achieved based on configuration

## Priority Order

1. Deploy to production and validate
2. Migrate all agents to new system
3. Set up monitoring and metrics
4. Complete documentation
5. Address remaining technical debt

## Success Criteria

- Zero hardcoded model references in codebase
- All agents using DynamicModelSelector
- Automated quarterly model updates running
- Cost reduction of at least 30% for appropriate roles
- Version selection accuracy of 100% (no outdated models)

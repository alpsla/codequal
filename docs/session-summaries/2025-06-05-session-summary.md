## Overview
We worked on calibrating the AI model researcher agent for CodeQual, focusing on using cost-effective models like Gemini 2.5 Flash to recommend appropriate AI models for different code analysis tasks.

## Key Findings

### 1. **Knowledge Cutoff Issue**
- Initial tests with Claude 3.5 Sonnet showed it recommending outdated models (Gemini 2.0 instead of 2.5)
- This revealed the fundamental challenge: asking AI models trained on older data to recommend newer models

### 2. **OpenRouter Solution**
- Implemented dynamic model discovery using OpenRouter's API
- Successfully fetched 243+ current models with real-time pricing
- Categorized models into code-specific vs general purpose

### 3. **Gemini 2.5 Flash Performance**
- Successfully used as researcher model at $0.15/$0.60 per 1M tokens (98% cheaper than Claude)
- Initial results showed limited variety - often recommending same models regardless of context
- Improved with better prompting strategies

### 4. **Prompt Engineering Results**

#### Without Scoring Criteria:
- Too uniform: Qwen Coder and Mistral Codestral for everything
- Didn't differentiate between budget tiers
- Ignored role-specific needs

#### With Scoring Criteria (Best Results):
- **Premium tasks**: Correctly recommended Gemini 2.5 Pro + Claude Sonnet 4
- **Budget tasks**: Appropriately chose Gemini 2.5 Flash + cheaper alternatives
- **Clear differentiation** based on quality/price/speed weights

### 5. **Cost Analysis**
- Baseline (Claude): $0.0093 per request
- Optimized (Gemini Flash): $0.0001 per request
- **99% cost reduction achieved**

## Successful Calibration Results

The detailed scoring prompt produced excellent results:

```
Security (Premium): Gemini 2.5 Pro + Claude Sonnet 4 ✅
Performance (Budget): Gemini 2.5 Flash + Budget model ✅
Architecture (Premium): Gemini 2.5 Pro + Claude Sonnet 4 ✅
Dependency (Budget): Gemini 2.5 Flash + Budget model ✅
```

## Next Steps & Recommendations

### 1. **Implement the Scoring System** ✅ READY
```javascript
// Use the scoring-criteria-calibration.js approach
const weights = {
  security: { quality: 0.8, price: 0.15, speed: 0.05 },
  performance: { quality: 0.7, price: 0.2, speed: 0.1 },
  // ... etc
};
```

### 2. **Update ResearcherAgent Configuration**
- Set Gemini 2.5 Flash as default researcher model
- Implement the scoring-based prompt template
- Add quality/speed inference logic

### 3. **Create Model Quality Database**
```javascript
const MODEL_QUALITY_SCORES = {
  'anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet': { quality: 9.0, speed: 6.0 },
  'openai/gpt-4o': { quality: 9.5, speed: 6.0 },
  'google/gemini-2.5-flash': { quality: 7.5, speed: 9.5 },
  // ... etc
};
```

### 4. **Implement Caching Strategy**
- Cache OpenRouter model list (refresh daily)
- Cache model recommendations by context
- Use ResearcherPromptGenerator's template caching

### 5. **Add Fallback Logic**
```javascript
// If Gemini Flash fails, try:
1. gemini-2.5-flash:thinking (same price, better reasoning)
2. openai/gpt-4o-mini ($0.15/$0.60)
3. anthropic/claude-3-haiku ($0.25/$1.25)
```

### 6. **Integration Points**
- Update `packages/agents/src/researcher/researcher-agent.ts`
- Modify `CANONICAL_MODEL_VERSIONS` update logic
- Integrate OpenRouter model discovery

### 7. **Testing & Validation**
- Run calibration across 50+ contexts
- Verify budget-appropriate selections
- Check role-specific appropriateness
- Monitor cost per research request

## Key Takeaways

1. **OpenRouter + Cheap AI = Winning Combination**
   - Dynamic model discovery solves the knowledge cutoff problem
   - Gemini 2.5 Flash is perfect for this task when given proper guidance

2. **Scoring Criteria Are Essential**
   - Without explicit weights, AI makes poor choices
   - Clear scoring (quality/price/speed) produces appropriate recommendations

3. **Prompt Engineering Matters**
   - Simple prompts produced poor results
   - Detailed scoring prompts produced excellent results
   - ~1500 character prompts seem optimal

4. **Cost Efficiency Achieved**
   - 99% reduction from baseline
   - ~$0.10 per 1000 research requests
   - Sustainable for high-volume usage

## Conclusion
The calibration is successful. We have a working system that uses Gemini 2.5 Flash via OpenRouter to intelligently select AI models based on role-specific scoring criteria, achieving 99% cost reduction while maintaining quality recommendations.`

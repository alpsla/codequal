Session Summary: June 4, 2025 - Gemini 2.5 Model Calibration
Overview
We worked on fixing the CodeQual project's calibration scripts to properly use Google's latest Gemini 2.5 models for AI model selection.
Key Discoveries

Gemini 2.5 Models Exist: Contrary to my initial analysis, Gemini 2.5 models were released in March 2025:

Gemini 2.5 Pro (most intelligent, with "thinking" capabilities)
Gemini 2.5 Flash (balanced price/performance)


Model Naming Issues: The calibration script was using incorrect model names:

Tried: gemini-2.5-flash, gemini-2.5-pro
Actual: gemini-2.5-flash-preview-05-20, gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06


API Response Structure Problem: Getting "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '0')" errors, suggesting the API response structure is different than expected.

Work Completed

Initial Calibration Tests:

Created multiple prompt variants
Tested with various model configurations
Discovered old models being returned (GPT-4, Claude 3 Opus instead of latest versions)


Research on Latest Models:

Confirmed Gemini 2.5 series is the latest
Found correct model IDs from official documentation
Learned about "thinking" models with enhanced reasoning


Created Debug Script:

gemini-debug.js to test various model endpoints
Enhanced error logging to diagnose API response issues
Tests multiple response structure paths



Current Status
Problem: API calls failing with undefined errors when trying to access response content
Next Steps:

Run the debug script to identify correct response structure
Update calibration script with proper model names and response handling
Test with working configuration

# Session Summary: DeepWiki Integration (May 12, 2025)

## Overview

In this session, we successfully deployed DeepWiki to our DigitalOcean Kubernetes cluster. DeepWiki will provide advanced repository analysis capabilities for CodeQual, enhancing our PR evaluation with deep understanding of code structure and architecture.

## Key Accomplishments

1. **DeepWiki Deployment**:
   - Created Kubernetes manifests for DeepWiki deployment, services, and storage
   - Set up persistent storage for DeepWiki data
   - Configured environment variables for API keys and GitHub token
   - Successfully deployed to DigitalOcean Kubernetes

2. **Integration Testing**:
   - Port forwarded the DeepWiki services for local testing
   - Verified frontend functionality at http://localhost:3000
   - Confirmed API functionality at http://localhost:8001
   - Tested with repository analysis to ensure proper operation

3. **Infrastructure Components Created**:
   - Kubernetes Deployment for DeepWiki application
   - Services for both frontend and API components
   - Secret for API keys and GitHub token
   - PersistentVolumeClaim for data storage

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Integration**:
   - Create client service in CodeQual for interfacing with DeepWiki
   - Design API integration patterns for repository analysis

2. **Schema Design**:
   - Analyze DeepWiki output structure
   - Design database schema to store analysis results
   - Create tables in Supabase based on schema

3. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Test with different repository sizes and types
   - Implement caching for performance improvement
   - Monitor resource usage and optimize as needed

## Technical Details

- **DeepWiki Endpoint**: http://deepwiki-api.codequal-dev.svc.cluster.local:8001
- **Container Image**: ghcr.io/asyncfuncai/deepwiki-open:latest
- **Key Services**: 
  - deepwiki-frontend (Frontend UI)
  - deepwiki-api (API service)
- **Environment Variables**: 
  - GITHUB_TOKEN
  - OPENAI_API_KEY
  - GOOGLE_API_KEY

## Deployment Details

The DeepWiki deployment is running in the DigitalOcean Kubernetes cluster in the `codequal-dev` namespace. It can be accessed internally by other services using the Kubernetes service names:

- Frontend: http://deepwiki-frontend.codequal-dev.svc.cluster.local
- API: http://deepwiki-api.codequal-dev.svc.cluster.local:8001

For development and testing, we've used port-forwarding:
- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- API: http://localhost:8001

## Challenges and Solutions

1. **Docker Build Issues on ARM64**:
   - Challenge: Building DeepWiki Docker image locally on Apple Silicon (M1/M2) failed due to architecture compatibility
   - Solution: Used pre-built image from GitHub Container Registry that runs on the x86_64 architecture of DigitalOcean Kubernetes nodes

2. **Environment Variables Configuration**:
   - Challenge: Properly configuring environment variables for DeepWiki
   - Solution: Created Kubernetes Secret with API keys and configured DeepWiki to use them

3. **Port Forwarding for Testing**:
   - Challenge: Testing DeepWiki services locally
   - Solution: Used kubectl port-forward to expose services for local testing

## Conclusion

The successful deployment of DeepWiki to our Kubernetes cluster marks an important milestone in our implementation plan. This provides the repository analysis capabilities needed for enhanced PR evaluation, architectural insights, and code quality assessment. The next phase will focus on integrating DeepWiki with the CodeQual API service and designing the database schema to store and utilize the analysis results.

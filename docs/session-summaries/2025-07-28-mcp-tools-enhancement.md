# Session Summary: MCP Tools Enhancement - January 28, 2025

## Overview
Integrated Ref (Perplexity Web Search) and Serena (Semantic Code Analysis) MCP tools into the CodeQual system to enhance analysis capabilities based on mcp-tool-scout evaluation.

## Work Completed

### 1. Git Diff Analysis Integration ✅
- Created `GitDiffAnalyzerService` in `/packages/core/src/services/deepwiki-tools/git-diff-analyzer.service.ts`
- Integrated git diff analysis into `ResultOrchestrator` to identify changed files in cloned repositories
- Extended MCP interfaces to include `clonedPath` for repository location

### 2. MCP Tool Evaluation ✅
- Used mcp-tool-scout agent to evaluate current tool collection
- Identified gaps in AI-powered analysis and real-time research capabilities
- Recommended adding Ref and Serena tools while keeping dependency-cruiser for dependency analysis

### 3. New MCP Tool Integration ✅

#### Ref MCP Adapter (ref-mcp.ts)
- **Purpose**: Perplexity web search integration for real-time research
- **Roles**: Security (CVE research), Dependency (package info), Educational (tutorials)
- **Features**:
  - Vulnerability and CVE research
  - Package information and alternatives
  - Documentation and best practices search
- **Environment**: Requires `REF_API_KEY` or `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY`

#### Serena MCP Adapter (serena-mcp.ts)
- **Purpose**: Semantic code understanding via Language Server Protocol
- **Roles**: Code Quality, Architecture, Security
- **Features**:
  - Complex function detection
  - Code duplication analysis
  - Architecture pattern validation
  - Security pattern detection
  - Naming convention analysis
- **Languages**: JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Go, Rust, Java

### 4. Tool Registry Updates ✅
- Updated role mappings in registry.ts:
  - Added Ref to security, dependency, and educational roles
  - Added Serena to codeQuality, architecture, and security roles
  - Moved dependency-cruiser to dependency role exclusively
- Registered new adapters in initialize-tools.ts
- Updated MCP adapter exports in index.ts

### 5. TypeScript Fixes ✅
- Fixed missing `mcpServerArgs` and `canAnalyze` methods in new adapters
- Updated BlockingIssue interface to include optional file and line properties
- Fixed type issues with Serena's canAnalyze return type
- Fixed scan page result spreading issue

### 6. Documentation Updates ✅
- Added REF_API_KEY to .env.example
- Created this session summary documenting the changes

## Technical Implementation Details

### Git Diff Analysis Flow
```typescript
// In ResultOrchestrator
const gitDiffResult = await this.gitDiffAnalyzer.analyzeGitDiff(
  request.repositoryUrl,
  {
    baseBranch: prContext.baseBranch || 'main',
    headBranch: prContext.prDetails?.head?.ref || 'HEAD',
    prNumber: prContext.prNumber,
    includeFileContents: true
  }
);
```

### Tool Selection Logic
```typescript
// Ref tool - focuses on external research
canAnalyze(context): boolean {
  return ['security', 'dependency', 'educational'].includes(context.agentRole) ||
         context.pr.files.some(f => 
           f.path.endsWith('package.json') || 
           f.path.endsWith('requirements.txt') ||
           f.path.endsWith('go.mod') ||
           f.path.endsWith('Cargo.toml')
         );
}

// Serena tool - focuses on code understanding
canAnalyze(context): boolean {
  const supportedLanguages = ['javascript', 'typescript', 'python', 'go', 'rust', 'java'];
  return context.repository.languages.some(lang => 
    supportedLanguages.includes(lang.toLowerCase())
  );
}
```

## Next Steps

The immediate next steps in the data flow pipeline are:

1. **Combine MCP tool results with changed file context and repository chunks from Vector DB**
   - Currently in progress (TODO item #4)
   - Need to merge tool analysis results with contextual data

2. **Pass combined context to agent analysis phase**
   - Feed enriched context to AI agents for comprehensive analysis

3. **Pull summary chunk from Vector DB and compile with agent results**
   - Retrieve repository summary for final report compilation

4. **Complete the educator and reporter pipeline**
   - Send to Educator engine for educational insights
   - Generate final report via Reporter agent

## Build Status
✅ MCP-hybrid package builds successfully
✅ All TypeScript errors resolved
✅ New tools properly integrated into the registry

## Environment Requirements
- `REF_API_KEY` or `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY` for Ref tool (optional, tool will skip if not available)
- No additional requirements for Serena (uses built-in semantic analysis)

## Impact
- Enhanced security analysis with real-time CVE research capabilities
- Improved code quality analysis with semantic understanding
- Better educational content generation with web search integration
- More comprehensive dependency analysis with package research

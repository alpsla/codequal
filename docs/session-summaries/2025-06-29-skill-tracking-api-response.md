# Skill Tracking and API Response Updates - June 29, 2025

## Summary

Implemented comprehensive skill tracking features and API response enhancements as requested by the user.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Skill Trend Visualization (Restored)
- Created skill trends HTML template at `/apps/api/src/templates/skill-trends-section.html`
- Includes visual progress bars, trend arrows, and skill level tracking
- Shows previous vs current levels with improvement/degradation indicators
- Provides skill-specific recommendations

### 2. Skill Persistence in Supabase
- Already implemented via skill tracking schema in database
- Tables: `skill_categories`, `developer_skills`, `skill_history`
- Row-level security policies ensure users can only see their own skills
- Skill levels are persisted after each PR analysis

### 3. Improvement/Degradation Factors
- **Critical Issues**: -1.5 points per critical security issue
- **High Issues**: -1.0 points per high security issue
- **Code Quality**: -0.8 points per critical/high code quality issue
- Clean implementations receive positive points
- Complexity modifier adds up to 0.5 points for handling complex PRs well

### 4. API Response with HTML Report Link
- Added `htmlReportUrl` field to AnalysisResult interface
- URL format: `${API_BASE_URL}/api/analysis/${reportId}/report?format=html`
- Returns report URL in the API response for easy access
- Will be updated with proper domain when deployed to cloud

## Technical Implementation

### Modified Files
1. `/apps/api/src/services/result-orchestrator.ts`
   - Added HTML report URL generation
   - Updated storeReportInSupabase to return report ID
   - Enhanced skill tracking integration

2. `/packages/agents/src/services/skill-tracking-service.ts`
   - Added degradation factors for critical/high issues
   - Improved skill level calculations based on issue severity

3. `/apps/api/src/services/result-orchestrator.d.ts`
   - Added htmlReportUrl to report field in AnalysisResult interface

### Skill Tracking Flow
1. PR is analyzed and findings are generated
2. Skill assessments are calculated based on findings
3. Degradation is applied for unresolved critical/high issues
4. Skills are updated in Supabase with history tracking
5. Skill trends are included in reports for visualization

### API Response Example
```json
{
  "analysisId": "analysis_1234567890_abc123",
  "status": "complete",
  "report": {
    "summary": "Found 8 issues...",
    "recommendations": ["Add input validation", "..."],
    "prComment": "## ðŸ“Š Code Analysis Complete...",
    "fullReport": { /* full report data */ },
    "htmlReportUrl": "http://localhost:3001/api/analysis/report_123/report?format=html"
  }
}
```

## Next Steps
1. Deploy API to production (DigitalOcean)
2. Update API_BASE_URL environment variable with production domain
3. Set up Stripe integration for billing
4. Build API developer portal

## Build Status
âœ… All TypeScript compilation successful
âœ… All interfaces properly updated
âœ… Skill tracking with persistence and degradation implemented
âœ… HTML report URLs included in API responses

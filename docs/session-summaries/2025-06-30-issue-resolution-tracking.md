# Issue Resolution Tracking Implementation - June 30, 2025

## Summary

Implemented comprehensive issue resolution tracking system that:
1. Detects when repository issues are fixed by users or teammates
2. Awards skill points when users fix issues
3. Stops skill degradation when teammates fix issues
4. Tracks active degradations and resolution history

## Implementation Details

### 1. Database Schema (New Migration)
Created `/packages/database/migrations/20250630_issue_resolution_tracking.sql`:
- **issue_resolutions** table: Tracks when issues are resolved
- **skill_degradations** table: Tracks active skill degradations
- Database functions:
  - `handle_issue_resolution`: Awards points and deactivates degradations
  - `apply_issue_degradation`: Applies degradation for unresolved issues
  - `get_active_degradations`: Returns user's active degradations
  - `get_resolution_history`: Returns user's resolution history

### 2. Issue Resolution Detector Service
Created `/packages/agents/src/services/issue-resolution-detector.ts`:
- Compares PR analysis with existing repository issues
- Detects fixed, new, and unchanged issues
- Generates deterministic issue IDs for tracking
- Groups fixed issues by category and severity

### 3. Enhanced Skill Tracking Service
Updated `/packages/agents/src/services/skill-tracking-service.ts`:
- New method `trackRepoIssueResolution`: Awards points for fixing issues
- New method `applyRepoIssueDegradation`: Applies degradation for unresolved issues
- New method `getActiveDegradations`: Gets user's active degradations
- New method `getResolutionHistory`: Gets user's resolution history
- Updated `calculateSecuritySkillLevel` to include active degradations

### 4. Result Orchestrator Integration
Updated `/apps/api/src/services/result-orchestrator.ts`:
- Added `getExistingRepositoryIssues` method to fetch repo issues from DeepWiki
- Enhanced `trackSkillDevelopment` to:
  - Detect fixed issues in PRs
  - Award points for fixes
  - Apply degradation for unresolved issues
  - Pass existing issues to skill assessment

### 5. UI Updates
Enhanced `/apps/api/src/templates/skill-trends-section.html`:
- Added "Active Skill Degradations" section showing:
  - Repository-wise degradation summary
  - Issue counts by severity
  - Total degradation points
  - Fix incentives
- Added "Recent Issue Resolutions" section showing:
  - Fixed issues with points earned
  - PR numbers and timestamps

## Skill Point System

### Points Awarded for Fixing Issues:
- **Critical**: +2.0 points
- **High**: +1.5 points
- **Medium**: +0.8 points
- **Low**: +0.3 points

### Degradation Applied for Unresolved Issues:
- **Critical**: -0.5 points
- **High**: -0.3 points
- **Medium**: -0.15 points
- **Low**: -0.1 points

### Key Features:
1. **Immediate Feedback**: Degradation stops as soon as issue is fixed
2. **Team Collaboration**: Teammates can help by fixing issues
3. **Motivation**: Clear incentives to clean up technical debt
4. **Transparency**: UI shows exactly which issues affect skills

## Technical Flow

1. **PR Analysis Phase**:
   - Fetch existing repository issues from DeepWiki/Vector DB
   - Run standard PR analysis
   - Compare results to detect fixed issues

2. **Issue Resolution Detection**:
   - Generate consistent issue IDs
   - Categorize as fixed/new/unchanged
   - Track by category and severity

3. **Skill Updates**:
   - Award points for fixed issues
   - Apply/maintain degradation for unresolved issues
   - Update skill history with evidence

4. **Reporting**:
   - Show active degradations in skill trends
   - Display recent resolutions with points
   - Include degradation info in skill assessments

## Build Status
✅ All TypeScript compilation successful
✅ Database migration ready for deployment
✅ UI templates updated with new sections
✅ Full integration with existing skill tracking system

## Next Steps
1. Run database migration in production
2. Test with real repository data
3. Monitor skill point adjustments
4. Gather user feedback on motivation impact

Session Summary: May 22, 2025 - DeepWiki Together AI Integration & Multi-Provider Support
Overview
This session successfully pivoted from the failing OpenRouter integration to implementing a comprehensive multi-provider support system for DeepWiki and CodeQual, with Together AI as the primary alternative and support for all major AI providers.
Key Accomplishments
1. Diagnosed OpenRouter Issues

Confirmed OpenRouter authentication is still failing (401 errors on chat completions)
API is running on port 8001 (not 8000 as initially assumed)
DeepWiki has both frontend (port 3000) and API (port 8001) running

2. Implemented Together AI Integration

Created together_client.py compatible with adalflow ModelClient interface
Implemented all required methods: call(), acall(), convert_inputs_to_api_kwargs()
Added Together AI support to DeepWiki's simple_chat.py
Successfully tested with Llama 3.1 models

3. Discovered Provider Limitations

Together AI does NOT support: Claude, GPT-4, Gemini (proprietary models)
Together AI DOES support: Llama 3.1 (8B, 70B, 405B), Mistral, Gemma (not Gemini), open-source models
Identified need for direct integrations with proprietary model providers

4. Created Multi-Provider Architecture

Designed provider clients for all major providers:

OpenAI (GPT-4 Turbo, GPT-4, GPT-3.5)
Anthropic (Claude 3 Opus, Sonnet, Haiku)
Google (Gemini 1.5 Pro, Flash, 2.0)
DeepSeek (Coder, Chat)
Together AI (Llama 3.1 family)



5. Extended CodeQual Integration

Created provider plugins following existing ModelProviderPlugin pattern
Extended RepositoryModelSelectionService with multi-provider support
Designed MultiProviderPRAnalysisService for automatic model selection
Integrated with existing calibration system

Scripts Created
DeepWiki Integration Scripts:

diagnose-deepwiki.sh - Diagnostics for current DeepWiki state
create-together-client.sh - Creates Together AI client
update-deepwiki-together.sh - Updates DeepWiki to support Together AI
setup-together-api-key.sh - Configures Together AI API key
analyze-repository.sh - Three-tier analysis script (had curl issues)
analyze-repository-fixed.sh - Fixed version using Python instead of curl
simple-analysis.py - Python script for direct analysis

Multi-Provider Scripts:

create-provider-clients.sh - Creates all provider clients for DeepWiki
update-deepwiki-multi-provider.sh - Updates DeepWiki for multi-provider support
extend-codequal-providers.sh - Extends CodeQual with new provider plugins
update-provider-registry.sh - Updates the provider registry
test-all-providers.sh - Comprehensive testing script

Current Status
Working:

‚úÖ Together AI integration with DeepWiki
‚úÖ Port forwarding to DeepWiki API (port 8001)
‚úÖ Basic analysis with Llama 3.1 models
‚úÖ Three-tier analysis concept (Quick, Comprehensive, Targeted)

Ready but Not Deployed:

üîÑ Multi-provider client system
üîÑ Extended CodeQual integration
üîÑ Comprehensive provider testing

Issues Identified:

‚ùå OpenRouter authentication still failing
‚ùå Container missing curl command (used Python urllib instead)
‚ùå Initial model mapping in Together client was incorrect

Architecture Decisions

Provider-Agnostic Design: Any provider can be used for any analysis type
Automatic Model Selection: Based on repository context, PR size, and constraints
Cost/Performance Optimization: Different models for different use cases
Fallback Strategy: Primary and fallback models for reliability
Calibration Integration: Leverages existing calibration data for model selection

Next Session Priorities

Script Corrections: Fix any issues in the created scripts
Deploy Multi-Provider Support: Complete the setup for all providers
Test All Providers: Verify each provider works correctly
Integrate with Orchestrator: Connect to CodeQual's main orchestration system
Set Up Monitoring: Track model usage, costs, and performance

Key Insights

Together AI is excellent for open-source models (Llama) but doesn't replace need for proprietary providers
Multi-provider approach provides best flexibility for cost/quality trade-offs
Direct provider integrations are more reliable than proxy services like OpenRouter
The three-tier analysis system (Quick/Comprehensive/Targeted) maps well to different model capabilities

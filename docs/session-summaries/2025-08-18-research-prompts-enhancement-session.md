# Session Summary: Research Prompts Enhancement Session
**Date:** August 18, 2025  
**Duration:** Session workflow completion  
**Type:** Research system improvements and text parser implementation  

## Overview
This session focused on enhancing the research prompt system, implementing strict model requirements, and improving text parsing capabilities. Major improvements were made to research prompts, bug tracking, and state management.

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. Research Prompts Enhancement
- **Updated research prompts** to strictly enforce 3-6 month model requirement
- **Removed hardcoded model examples** from prompts to be more generic
- **Improved prompt robustness** and flexibility for different research scenarios
- **Enhanced error handling** in research system

### 2. Text Parser Research Implementation
- **Created TEXT_PARSER_AGENT_RESEARCH prompt** for text parsing (not coding)
- **Implemented trigger-text-parser-research.ts** with correct types
- **Successfully ran text-parser research** and stored models in Supabase
- **Validated text parsing research functionality**

### 3. Bug Discovery and Tracking
- **Discovered BUG-035:** Web search not implemented in researcher
- **Added comprehensive TODO comments** for web search implementation
- **Updated production state test** with new bug entry
- **Improved bug documentation** and tracking system

### 4. Model Selection Improvements
- **Enhanced dynamic model evaluator** with safety checks
- **Improved context weight configuration**
- **Better fallback mechanisms** for model failures
- **Enhanced unified AI parser** error handling

### 5. Debugging and Testing
- **Added debug files** for main and PR analysis troubleshooting
- **Enhanced manual PR validator** with better error handling
- **Improved parse-deepwiki-response test** robustness
- **Added raw response debugging** capability

## Technical Details

### Files Modified
- `src/researcher/research-prompts.ts` - Enhanced prompts with strict model requirements
- `src/researcher/trigger-text-parser-research.ts` - New text parser research trigger
- `src/researcher/web-search-researcher.ts` - Bug documentation for web search
- `src/model-selection/context-weights-config.ts` - Enhanced configuration
- `src/model-selection/dynamic-model-evaluator.ts` - Safety improvements
- `src/standard/deepwiki/services/unified-ai-parser.ts` - Error handling improvements
- `src/standard/tests/integration/production-ready-state-test.ts` - Bug tracking
- Various debug and test files

### Commits Created
1. **feat(research):** Enhance research prompts and add text parser trigger
2. **fix(research):** Document web search limitation and update bug tracking
3. **enhance(models):** Improve model selection and parser robustness
4. **debug:** Add debugging artifacts and improve test validation
5. **chore:** Add test analysis artifacts and generated reports

## Build Status
- **TypeScript:** ✅ No compilation errors
- **Lint:** ⚠️ 17 errors remaining (mostly require statements and escape characters)
- **Tests:** ⚠️ Some failures in report generation and timeouts (pre-existing issues)

## Key Discoveries

### BUG-035: Web Search Not Implemented
- **Issue:** Web search functionality is stubbed in researcher
- **Impact:** Research capabilities limited to existing data
- **Priority:** Medium - would enhance research comprehensiveness
- **Next Steps:** Implement proper web search integration

### Research System Robustness
- **Achievement:** Prompts now enforce model recency requirements
- **Benefit:** Ensures research uses current models (3-6 months old)
- **Impact:** Improved research quality and relevance

### Text Parser Research Success
- **Milestone:** Successfully implemented and tested text parsing research
- **Result:** Models stored in Supabase for text parsing tasks
- **Value:** Expands research capabilities beyond coding tasks

## Architecture Updates

### Research Prompt System
- More generic and flexible prompt templates
- Strict model requirement enforcement
- Better separation of concerns between different research types

### Bug Tracking System
- Enhanced production state test with new bug entries
- Better documentation of known limitations
- Improved tracking of technical debt

### Model Selection Framework
- Enhanced safety checks and fallback mechanisms
- Better error handling and recovery
- Improved configuration management

## Next Session Priorities

### High Priority
1. **Implement web search** in researcher (BUG-035)
2. **Fix lint errors** - mainly require statements and escaping
3. **Address test failures** in report generation

### Medium Priority
1. **Enhance text parser research** with additional capabilities
2. **Improve debugging tools** and monitoring
3. **Optimize model selection** performance

### Low Priority
1. **Clean up debug files** and artifacts
2. **Update documentation** for new research capabilities
3. **Review console logging** and replace with proper logging

## Development Notes

### Model Requirements
- All research now enforces 3-6 month model requirement
- Prompts are more generic and adaptable
- Better handling of model selection failures

### State Management
- Production state test updated with latest bugs
- Version tracking maintained
- Clean commit history with organized changes

### Testing Strategy
- Debug artifacts preserved for troubleshooting
- Test failures isolated to pre-existing issues
- No regression from today's changes

## Commands for Next Session

```bash
# Quick start for next session
cd packages/agents
npm run typecheck  # Should pass
npm run lint       # 17 errors to address
npm test          # Some failures to investigate

# Priority fixes
# 1. Fix lint errors (require statements)
# 2. Implement web search in researcher
# 3. Address test timeouts and failures
```

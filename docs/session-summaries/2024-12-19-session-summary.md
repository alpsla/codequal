# Session Summary: December 19, 2024 - Real Adapter Testing

## Overview
Today's session focused on fixing and running real (non-mocked) tests for MCP and Direct adapters in the CodeQual project. We made significant progress on Direct adapters while identifying that MCP adapters require server dependencies that are not currently available.

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. Fixed Prettier Direct Adapter Tests ‚úÖ
**Issue**: Tests were failing because Prettier was trying to check files that didn't exist on disk.

**Solution**: Created `real-prettier-execution-fixed.test.ts` that:
- Writes test files to a temporary directory
- Updates file paths in the context to point to actual files
- Properly cleans up after tests

**Result**: All 5 tests passing successfully

### 2. Fixed Dependency Cruiser TypeScript Errors ‚úÖ
**Issue**: Template literals inside string content were causing TypeScript compilation errors.

**Solution**: 
- Changed template literals to string concatenation (`'user:' + id` instead of `` `user:${id}` ``)
- Fixed all 12 TypeScript errors in the test file

**Result**: Code compiles successfully, dependency-cruiser is available for testing

### 3. Identified MCP Server Dependency Issue üîç
**Finding**: All MCP adapter tests (Chart.js, Context, MCP-Scan, Docs Service) require actual MCP servers to be running.

**Current Status**: 
- No MCP server packages found in node_modules
- MCP servers would need to be installed, built from source, or mocked

### 4. Created Diagnostic Scripts üõ†Ô∏è
Created several helper scripts to diagnose tool availability:
- `test-prettier-availability.sh` - Checks if Prettier is installed
- `test-dependency-cruiser-availability.sh` - Checks dependency-cruiser
- `check-mcp-servers.sh` - Looks for MCP server installations
- `test-grafana-connection.sh` - Tests Grafana API connectivity

## Current Test Status

### Working Tests ‚úÖ
1. **ESLint MCP** - Already working (from previous sessions)
2. **Prettier Direct** - Fixed and all 5 tests passing

### Ready to Test üîß
1. **Dependency Cruiser Direct** - TypeScript errors fixed, tool is available
2. **Grafana Direct** - Has environment variables configured

### Blocked by Dependencies ‚ùå
1. **Chart.js MCP** - Requires MCP server
2. **Context MCP** - Requires MCP server
3. **MCP-Scan** - Requires MCP server
4. **Docs Service** - Requires MCP server

## Key Insights

1. **Real Tests Need Real Files**: Direct adapter tests must write actual files to disk for tools like Prettier and dependency-cruiser to analyze them.

2. **MCP vs Direct Architecture**: 
   - Direct adapters: Call tools directly via command line
   - MCP adapters: Communicate with MCP servers via JSON-RPC protocol

3. **Global Tool Installation**: Dependency-cruiser shows a warning about global installation but still works for testing.

4. **Grafana Implementation**: The current Grafana adapter mostly returns mock data rather than making real API calls.

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. Run the dependency-cruiser test now that TypeScript errors are fixed
2. Test Grafana adapter with the configured environment variables
3. Focus on Direct adapters since they don't require additional server infrastructure

### Future Improvements
1. Consider implementing mock MCP servers for testing
2. Document MCP server setup requirements
3. Enhance Grafana adapter to make real API calls
4. Add CI/CD configuration to handle tool availability

## Files Created/Modified

### Test Files
- `/src/adapters/__tests__/real-prettier-execution-fixed.test.ts` - Fixed Prettier tests
- `/src/adapters/direct/__tests__/dependency-cruiser-simplified.test.ts` - Simplified DC test

### Scripts
- `test-prettier-availability.sh`
- `test-dependency-cruiser-availability.sh`  
- `check-mcp-servers.sh`
- `test-grafana-connection.sh`
- `run-single-real-test.sh` (updated)
- `run-all-real-tests.sh` (updated)

### Documentation
- `/docs/real-adapter-testing-summary.md` - Comprehensive testing guide
- `/docs/real-test-status-summary.md` - Current status overview

## Next Steps

1. **Test Dependency Cruiser**: 
   ```bash
   ./run-single-real-test.sh dependency-cruiser
   ```

2. **Test Grafana Adapter**:
   ```bash
   ./run-single-real-test.sh grafana
   ```

3. **Consider MCP Strategy**:
   - Skip MCP tests for now
   - Or implement mock servers
   - Or document how to install real MCP servers

## Summary
We successfully fixed the Direct adapter tests, with Prettier fully working and Dependency Cruiser ready to test. The main blocker for complete test coverage is the availability of MCP servers, which would need to be addressed based on project requirements.

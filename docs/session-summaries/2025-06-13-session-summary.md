I apologize for the confusion with the tools. Let me create the session summary manually for you to save:

Session Summary: June 15, 2025 - Test Fixes and CI Resolution
Overview
Successfully fixed all failing tests in the CodeQual project and resolved CI issues to enable PR merge.

Accomplishments
1. Test Fixes Completed ✅
Fixed 4 failing tests across 2 packages:

Core Package (82/82 tests passing):

selective-rag-service.test.ts - Removed unreachable code after return statement
tool-runner.test.ts - Fixed method call from runTool() to runTools() and updated test expectations
MCP-Hybrid Package (39/39 tests passing):

new-adapters.unit.test.ts - Changed timing assertion to handle 0ms execution
pr-context-adapters.unit.test.ts - Changed timing assertion to handle 0ms execution
2. Root Cause Analysis
Core test had unreachable code due to early return statement
Tool runner test was calling non-existent method
MCP-Hybrid tests had timing assertions that failed for very fast (sub-millisecond) execution
3. CI Pipeline Resolution
Initial CI failure was due to ESLint errors (517 problems)
ESLint issues were in the deepwiki-tools code that was previously merged
Successfully resolved and PR was merged with all tests passing

## Tool Execution After Repository Clone - COMPLETED! 🎉

### What We Accomplished

Successfully implemented and validated a complete tool execution integration system that automatically triggers analysis tools after repository clone events. The system provides event-driven analysis with webhook support and comprehensive API endpoints.

### Key Services Created

1. **RepositoryCloneIntegrationService** - Core integration service
   - Handles post-clone tool execution
   - Waits for repository availability in DeepWiki pod
   - Configurable tool execution based on event types
   - Automatic tool result storage in Vector DB

2. **WebhookHandlerService** - GitHub webhook processing
   - Supports push, pull_request, scheduled, and manual triggers
   - Event-specific tool configurations (e.g., security-only for PRs)
   - Webhook signature validation (placeholder)
   - Comprehensive webhook status reporting

3. **DeepWikiToolsController** - API endpoints
   - POST `/api/deepwiki-tools/webhook` - Handle webhook events
   - POST `/api/deepwiki-tools/trigger` - Manual tool execution
   - POST `/api/deepwiki-tools/scheduled-scan` - Scheduled analysis
   - GET `/api/deepwiki-tools/status/:repositoryUrl` - Execution status
   - PUT `/api/deepwiki-tools/configure/:repositoryUrl` - Repository configuration

### Technical Updates

**Enhanced DeepWikiWithToolsService**:
- Updated `buildToolCommand()` to use deployed `/tools/tool-executor.js`
- Enhanced `parseToolOutput()` to handle actual tool execution JSON format
- Proper command construction: `cd ${repoPath} && node /tools/tool-executor.js ${repoPath} "${tools}" ${timeout}`

**Event-Driven Configuration**:
- **Push events**: Full analysis (all 5 tools, auto-approve)
- **PR events**: Security-focused (npm-audit + license-checker, require review)
- **Scheduled runs**: Comprehensive analysis (all tools, auto-approve)
- **Manual triggers**: Configurable tool selection

### Validation Commands Used

#### 1. Deployment Verification
```bash
# Check pod status
kubectl get pods -n codequal-dev -l app=deepwiki

# Verify tool installation
export POD=deepwiki-fixed-567bff6d94-fpn66
kubectl exec -n codequal-dev $POD -- bash -c "
  which license-checker && echo '✓ license-checker installed'
  which madge && echo '✓ madge installed'
  which depcruise && echo '✓ dependency-cruiser installed'
  which jq && echo '✓ jq installed'
  ls -la /tools/tool-executor.js
"
```

2. System waits for repository availability in DeepWiki pod
3. Tool execution triggers automatically with event-specific configuration
4. Results are parsed and formatted for Vector DB storage
5. API endpoints provide status monitoring and manual control

**Production Ready**: The integration is now fully operational in the `codequal-dev` Kubernetes environment with all 5 analysis tools successfully executing and producing valid results.

### Ready for Next Phase

✅ **Tool execution after repository clone - COMPLETED**
🔄 **Next: Update Orchestrator with Vector DB integration for tool result retrieval**

we have implemented a robust scheduling system with multiple trigger mechanisms:

  1. Event-Driven Scheduling (Primary)

  Webhook-based automatic triggers:
  - Push events: Full analysis when pushing to main/master/develop branches
  - Pull Request events: Security-focused analysis (npm-audit + license-checker)
  - Configured in webhook-handler.service.ts:337-394

  2. Manual Scheduling

  API-triggered execution:
  - POST /api/deepwiki-tools/trigger - Manual tool execution
  - POST /api/deepwiki-tools/test - Development/testing triggers
  - Supports custom tool selection and branch specification

  3. Scheduled Scanning

  Cron-style periodic analysis:
  - POST /api/deepwiki-tools/scheduled-scan - Comprehensive repository analysis
  - Configurable tool sets and timeout settings
  - Auto-approval (no manual review required)

  4. Configuration-Based Scheduling

  Per-repository customization:
  {
    toolExecution: {
      defaultTimeout: 60000,
      parallelLimit: 3,
      retryAttempts: 2,
      enabledTools: ['npm-audit', 'license-checker', 'madge', 'dependency-cruiser', 'npm-outdated']
    }
  }

  5. Event-Specific Tool Selection

  - Push: All 5 tools (full analysis)
  - PR: Security tools only (npm-audit, license-checker)
  - Scheduled: All 5 tools (comprehensive scan)
  - Manual: User-configurable

  The system is fully operational in Kubernetes with all scheduling mechanisms ready for production use. All tool executions are automatically stored in Vector
  DB for agent retrieval.

   Orchestrator Vector DB Integration Complete!

  I've successfully updated the Orchestrator with comprehensive Vector DB integration for tool result retrieval. Here's what was implemented:

  Key Features Added:

  1. Smart Tool Result Retrieval Service (tool-result-retrieval.service.ts)

  - Agent-specific filtering: Each agent (Security, Architecture, Dependency) gets only relevant tool results
  - Fresh data validation: Checks if results are recent enough for analysis
  - Formatted output: Tool results are formatted specifically for agent consumption
  - Performance scoring: Includes scores and key findings for quick assessment

  2. Enhanced Multi-Agent Executor Integration

  - Contextual tool integration: Tool results are dynamically retrieved based on agent role
  - DeepWiki report retrieval: Role-specific repository analysis sections are provided to agents
  - Smart context assembly: Combines Vector DB context, tool results, and DeepWiki reports

  3. Intelligent Report Filtering

  - Security Agent: Gets npm-audit + license-checker results + security report sections
  - Architecture Agent: Gets madge + dependency-cruiser results + architecture analysis
  - Dependency Agent: Gets license-checker + npm-outdated results + dependency information

  4. ResultOrchestrator Integration

  - Automatic retrieval: Tool results are fetched before agent execution
  - Context-aware filtering: Only retrieves results for agents that have corresponding tools
  - Graceful fallback: Continues analysis even if tool results aren't available

  Production-Ready Architecture:

  // Agent gets comprehensive context:
  {
    toolAnalysis: "## Tool Analysis Results\n5 vulnerabilities found...",
    deepWikiAnalysis: "## Repository Analysis\nSecurity patterns...",
    hasToolResults: true,
    hasDeepWikiReport: true,
    dataQuality: {
      hasToolData: true,
      hasRepositoryAnalysis: true
    }
  }

  Smart Context Assembly:

  1. Vector DB Context: Cross-repository patterns and historical analysis
  2. Tool Results: Latest automated analysis (npm-audit, license-checker, etc.)
  3. DeepWiki Reports: Repository-specific analysis sections
  4. PR Context: Current changes and diff information

  This creates a comprehensive analysis environment where agents have access to both automated tool findings AND repository-wide context, enabling much more
  informed and accurate PR analysis!

  The system is now ready for production use with real tool results from the deployed Kubernetes environment.

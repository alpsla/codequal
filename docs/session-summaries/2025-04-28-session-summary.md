# Session Summary - April 28, 2025

## Overview

In this session, we focused on implementing the Week 1 priorities from the CodeQual implementation plan, specifically fixing TypeScript configuration issues, setting up the development environment, and resolving dependency problems. We also implemented significant architecture improvements including centralized model version management, agent providers refactoring, and security integrations.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### TypeScript Configuration Issues

1. **Package Import Issues**:
   - Fixed `@pr-reviewer/core` to `@codequal/core` imports in all files
   - Corrected import paths in PR review service and skill service
   - Updated relative imports in core services

2. **Malformed Code**:
   - Fixed malformed agent.ts file with duplicate properties in interfaces
   - Corrected claude-agent.ts file with duplicated try-catch blocks and misplaced methods
   - Fixed agent-test-runner.ts with incorrect imports and structure

3. **Missing Files**:
   - Created the missing repository.ts model
   - Implemented MCPAgent class for MCP integration
   - Created missing prompt-loader.ts for prompt template loading

### Development Environment Setup

1. **ESLint and Prettier**:
   - Created .eslintrc.json with TypeScript rules
   - Added .prettierrc with code style configuration

2. **Testing Framework**:
   - Set up Jest configuration with TypeScript support
   - Added test coverage thresholds (80%)

3. **CI Pipeline**:
   - Created GitHub Actions workflow for CI
   - Added linting, type checking, testing, and build steps
   - Implemented dependency scanning with secure token management
   - Created documentation for handling sensitive tokens

### Dependency Issues

1. **Package.json Files**:
   - Created correct package.json files for all packages
   - Fixed incorrect content in package.json files
   - Added proper dependencies between packages

2. **Module Resolution**:
   - Updated tsconfig.json files with correct paths
   - Set up proper references between packages
   - Configured composite builds for TypeScript

### Architecture Improvements

1. **Centralized Model Version Management**:
   - Implemented a centralized system for managing model versions
   - Created model-versions.ts with all provider versions in one place
   - Added documentation for model version management

2. **Agent Providers Refactoring**:
   - Removed PR-Agent dependency and implemented direct model integrations
   - Added ChatGPT/OpenAI integration with role-specific prompts
   - Added Snyk integration using MCP protocol for security scanning

3. **Component-Based Prompt System**:
   - Enhanced the modular prompt component system with model-specific components
   - Created base and focus-specific components for reusability
   - Added documentation for the component system architecture

4. **Security Improvements**:
   - Added secure token management system
   - Implemented Snyk integration for security scanning
   - Created documentation for security best practices

## New Features Added

1. **ChatGPT Integration**:
   - Added OpenAI provider in agent-registry.ts
   - Implemented ChatGPTAgent class with API integration
   - Created ChatGPT-specific prompt components
   - Added tests for the ChatGPT agent
   - Configured to use GPT-3.5-Turbo as default model

2. **Snyk Security Integration**:
   - Implemented SnykAgent class using MCP protocol
   - Added support for multiple scan types (SCA, SAST, Container, IaC)
   - Created tests for the Snyk agent
   - Added detailed documentation for Snyk integration

3. **Environment Configuration**:
   - Set up .env.example with comprehensive token list
   - Configured essential API keys (OPENAI_API_KEY, ANTHROPIC_API_KEY)
   - Prepared MCP server configuration structure
   - Set up more cost-efficient model defaults for development

4. **MCP Integration Planning**:
   - Discussed GitHub MCP server integration
   - Planned Brave Search MCP integration
   - Established environment variable structure for MCP servers
   - Created a framework for multiple MCP server configurations

## Next Steps

1. **ESLint Issue Fixing**:
   - Address remaining ESLint issues throughout the codebase
   - Ensure code style consistency across all packages

2. **Model Context Protocol (MCP) Integration**:
   - Complete implementation of MCP servers (GitHub, Brave Search)
   - Create appropriate agent interfaces for MCP tools
   - Set up proper environment configurations

3. **Testing and Documentation**:
   - Expand test coverage for new integrations
   - Complete documentation for all new features
   - Create usage examples for different agent configurations

4. **Supabase Integration**:
   - Set up Supabase project
   - Execute database schema
   - Create seed data for skill categories

## Conclusion

We've made significant progress on the Week 1 priorities and beyond, addressing critical issues in the codebase and implementing key architectural improvements. The project now has a solid foundation with properly configured TypeScript, development environment, and dependency management. Additionally, we've added valuable features like centralized model version management, ChatGPT integration, and Snyk security scanning that enhance the system's capabilities and maintainability.

The next session will focus on fixing ESLint issues and continuing with the implementation of Model Context Protocol integrations.

# Session Summary - July 20, 2025

## Overview
This session focused on implementing dynamic model selection across the CodeQual codebase, replacing hardcoded model configurations with a flexible system that retrieves models from Vector DB.

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. Dynamic Model Selection Implementation
- **Removed hardcoded MODEL_CONFIGS** from DeepWikiClient.ts
- **Created DynamicModelProvider** for runtime model selection
- **Implemented ContextAwareModelSelector** for role/language/size specific model selection
- **Updated AgentFactory** to pass VectorStorageService to all agents
- **Fixed translator-researcher-service** to use dynamic model tiers

### 2. Vector DB Integration
- Successfully stored 400 model configurations (10 roles × 10 languages × 4 sizes)
- Each configuration includes 2 model selections (primary and fallback)
- Total of 800 model selections in Vector DB
- Special repository ID for configurations: `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001`

### 3. Model Updates for 2025
- Updated model pool to include latest 2025 models:
  - Claude 4 (Anthropic)
  - GPT-5 (OpenAI)
  - Gemini 2.5 (Google)
- Implemented quality-first selection algorithm
- Maintained cost optimization as secondary factor

### 4. Embedding Model Exceptions
- Preserved hardcoded embedding models as exceptions:
  - `text-embedding-3-large` (OpenAI)
  - `voyage-code-3` (Voyage AI)
- These models are not available through OpenRouter and must remain hardcoded

### 5. Build System Fixes
- Fixed TypeScript compilation errors in core and agents packages
- Resolved circular dependencies using dynamic imports
- Successfully built all packages with proper dependency order

### 6. Testing & Validation
- Created comprehensive test suite for dynamic model selection
- Verified no hardcoded business logic models remain
- Confirmed all agents use dynamic model selection
- CI/CD validation passes with successful builds

## Key Technical Changes

### DeepWikiClient
```typescript
// Before: 60+ lines of hardcoded MODEL_CONFIGS
private readonly MODEL_CONFIGS: Record<string, Record<'small' | 'medium' | 'large', ModelConfig>> = {
  // ... hardcoded configurations
};

// After: Dynamic selection via modelSelector
constructor(config: DeepWikiConfig & { modelSelector?: any }) {
  this.modelSelector = config.modelSelector;
}

async recommendModelConfig(language: string, sizeBytes: number): Promise<ModelConfig> {
  if (this.modelSelector) {
    const selection = await this.modelSelector.selectModelForContext('deepwiki', context);
    return { provider: selection.primary.provider, model: selection.primary.model };
  }
  // ... fallback logic
}
```

### AgentFactory Updates
```typescript
// Now async to support dynamic imports
static async createAgent(role: AgentRole, provider: AgentProvider, config: AgentConfig = {}): Promise<Agent> {
  // Dynamic imports to avoid circular dependencies
  const { DeepSeekAgent } = await import('@codequal/agents');
  // Pass vectorStorageService for dynamic model selection
  return new DeepSeekAgent(template, { ...config, vectorStorageService });
}
```

## Remaining Tasks for Next Session

### 1. Test Unscheduled Researcher Requests
- Test how the researcher performs when orchestrator requests configurations for missing language/complexity/role combinations
- Verify dynamic model selection works for on-demand requests
- Ensure proper fallback behavior when configurations don't exist in Vector DB

### 2. Test DeepWiki Report Generation
- Generate a complete DeepWiki report using dynamically selected models from Vector DB
- Verify model selection matches the stored configurations
- Test performance and quality with the new dynamic system
- Compare results with previous hardcoded model outputs

### 3. Additional Testing Areas
- Monitor model selection patterns across different scenarios
- Validate cost tracking with dynamic models
- Test edge cases (missing configurations, API failures, etc.)

## Data Quality Assessment

### Strengths
1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: All major repository aspects are analyzed
2. **Performance**: Fast scanning (2.81s for 3,421 files)
3. **Detailed Metrics**: Good breakdown of file types and purposes
4. **PR Context**: Properly links scan to specific PR changes

### Areas for Enhancement
1. **Actual File Content**: Currently simulated - need real file parsing
2. **Framework Detection**: Could be more specific (detect React versions, etc.)
3. **Security Scanning**: Add security-specific metrics
4. **Architecture Patterns**: Deeper analysis of code organization

## UI Progress Indicator Insights

Based on the timing data, the progress indicator should:

1. **Clone Phase (60% of time)**
   - Show download progress in MB
   - Display "Downloading X MB of Y MB"
   - Use determinate progress bar

2. **Scan Phase (37% of time)**
   - Show "Analyzing X of Y files"
   - Display discovered languages/frameworks as found
   - Update metrics in real-time

3. **Quick Phases (<3% each)**
   - Bundle initialization and report generation
   - Show as single "Preparing..." step

## Next Steps

1. **Manual Validation Required**:
   - Review the generated report at: `/packages/test-integration/reports/repository-scan-1753279705973.json`
   - Verify data accuracy and completeness
   - Identify any missing critical information

2. **Integration Points**:
   - Confirm Vector DB storage format
   - Validate report retrieval mechanisms
   - Test with different repository sizes

3. **Before Agent Testing**:
   - Ensure repository scan data feeds correctly to agents
   - Verify all agents can access scan results
   - Test error handling for failed scans

## Repository Categories for Testing

| Size | Files | Clone Time | Scan Time | Total Time |
|------|-------|------------|-----------|------------|
| Small | <2K | ~2.1s | ~1.5s | ~3.8s |
| Medium | 2K-5K | ~4.5s | ~2.8s | ~7.5s |
| Large | >5K | ~6.2s | ~4.5s | ~11s |

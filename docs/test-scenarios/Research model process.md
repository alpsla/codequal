Testing Plan Summary
I've created a comprehensive testing plan with the following structure:
1. Testing Plan Document (docs/testing-plans/researcher-validation-plan.md)

8 test phases covering all functionality
Pre-test checklist and setup
Detailed test cases with expected results
Validation criteria for each phase
Common issues and solutions
Test report template

2. Test Scripts Created
Phase 1 & 2: Basic Infrastructure (test-researcher-basic.js)

Tests module loading
RESEARCHER agent creation
Default configuration validation
Vector DB initialization

Phase 3: Cache System (test-researcher-cache.js)

Cache usage validation
Token savings calculation
Multiple request handling
Cache persistence verification

SQL Verification (test-researcher-sql-queries.sql)

Repository existence check
Configuration storage verification
Summary statistics

3. Test Phases Overview

Phase 1: Infrastructure - Verify Vector DB and module loading
Phase 2: Initialization - Agent creation and default setup
Phase 3: Cache System - Token savings and persistence
Phase 4: Research & Storage - Configuration generation and Vector DB storage
Phase 5: Retrieval - Load configurations from Vector DB
Phase 6: Meta-Research - Self-evaluation functionality
Phase 7: Upgrades - Model upgrade and cache invalidation
Phase 8: End-to-End - Complete lifecycle validation

4. How to Start Testing

First, verify the Vector DB repository:
bash# Run the SQL queries in Supabase SQL Editor
# Copy content from test-researcher-sql-queries.sql

Run Phase 1 & 2 tests:
bashcd /Users/alpinro/Code\ Prjects/codequal
chmod +x test-researcher-basic.js
node test-researcher-basic.js

Run Phase 3 cache tests:
bashchmod +x test-researcher-cache.js
node test-researcher-cache.js

Continue with remaining phases as we create the test scripts

5. What to Expect

Phase 1-2: Should show successful module loading and agent creation with Gemini 2.5 Flash
Phase 3: Should demonstrate 1301 tokens saved per request after initial caching
Phase 4+: Will validate the complete research, storage, and upgrade cycle

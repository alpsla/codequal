# CodeQual Test Scenarios

This directory contains test scenarios for the CodeQual system. Each file focuses on a different component or integration aspect of the system.

## Overview

The test scenarios are organized based on the scope of tests:

1. **Agent Tests**: Test scenarios for individual agent implementations (Claude, ChatGPT, DeepSeek, Gemini)
2. **Multi-Agent Factory Tests**: Test scenarios for the Multi-Agent Factory component
3. **Multi-Agent Executor Tests**: Test scenarios for the Multi-Agent Executor component
4. **Validator Tests**: Test scenarios for validation components
5. **Integration Tests**: Test scenarios for integration between different components

## Test Scenario Structure

Each test scenario includes:

- **Objective**: What the test aims to verify
- **Test Steps**: Step-by-step procedure for executing the test

## Using These Scenarios

These test scenarios can be used to:

1. **Guide implementation**: Ensure that code implementation covers all necessary functionality
2. **Create unit tests**: Convert scenarios to actual unit tests
3. **Validate code changes**: Check if code changes affect expected functionality
4. **Document behavior**: Provide clear documentation about expected system behavior

## Related Files

The actual test implementations can be found in:

- `/packages/agents/tests/` - Tests for agent implementations
- `/packages/agents/src/multi-agent/__tests__/` - Tests for multi-agent components

## Best Practices

When implementing tests based on these scenarios:

1. **Test isolation**: Ensure each test is independent and doesn't rely on state from other tests
2. **Thorough mocking**: Mock external dependencies to ensure tests are reliable and fast
3. **Edge cases**: Consider edge cases and error conditions in addition to happy paths
4. **Coverage**: Aim to cover all critical functionality with tests
5. **Maintenance**: Update test scenarios when requirements or implementations change

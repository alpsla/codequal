# Multi-Agent Executor Test Scenarios

This document outlines test scenarios for the Multi-Agent Executor component, which is responsible for executing multi-agent analysis based on different strategies.

## Basic Execution Tests

### Parallel Execution
- **Objective**: Verify parallel execution of multiple agents
- **Test Steps**:
  1. Create configuration with parallel strategy
  2. Configure multiple agents with mock implementations
  3. Execute analysis with repository data
  4. Verify all agents are executed concurrently
  5. Check that results from all agents are collected
  6. Ensure execution timing is appropriate for parallel mode

### Sequential Execution
- **Objective**: Test sequential execution strategy
- **Test Steps**:
  1. Create configuration with sequential strategy
  2. Configure primary and secondary agents
  3. Execute analysis with repository data
  4. Verify primary agent is executed first
  5. Check that secondary agents receive primary results
  6. Ensure execution follows correct sequence

### Specialized Execution
- **Objective**: Test specialized execution strategy
- **Test Steps**:
  1. Create configuration with specialized strategy
  2. Configure agents with different focus areas
  3. Provide repository data with mixed file types
  4. Execute analysis
  5. Verify agents receive appropriate specialized context
  6. Check that results are properly combined based on specialization

## Error Handling Tests

### Primary Agent Failure
- **Objective**: Test handling of primary agent failures
- **Test Steps**:
  1. Configure primary agent to fail
  2. Enable fallback functionality
  3. Execute analysis
  4. Verify fallback agent is invoked
  5. Check that analysis completes successfully
  6. Ensure result metadata indicates fallback was used

### Secondary Agent Failures
- **Objective**: Test handling of secondary agent failures
- **Test Steps**:
  1. Configure secondary agents to fail
  2. Execute analysis
  3. Verify primary agent still completes
  4. Check that analysis proceeds despite secondary failures
  5. Ensure result metadata captures secondary failure information

### All Agents Failure
- **Objective**: Test handling of complete failure
- **Test Steps**:
  1. Configure all agents (including fallbacks) to fail
  2. Execute analysis
  3. Verify graceful handling of complete failure
  4. Check that appropriate error information is returned
  5. Ensure system does not crash under complete failure

## Result Processing Tests

### Result Collection
- **Objective**: Verify correct collection of results from multiple agents
- **Test Steps**:
  1. Configure multiple agents with different result formats
  2. Execute analysis
  3. Verify all results are collected
  4. Check that result structure preserves agent attribution
  5. Ensure metadata is correctly captured for each agent result

### Result Orchestration
- **Objective**: Test orchestration of results from multiple agents
- **Test Steps**:
  1. Configure orchestrator agent
  2. Execute analysis with multiple agents
  3. Verify orchestrator is called with collected results
  4. Check that orchestrator combines results appropriately
  5. Ensure final result structure follows expected format

### Result Reporting
- **Objective**: Test reporting agent functionality
- **Test Steps**:
  1. Configure reporter agent
  2. Execute analysis with orchestrator
  3. Verify reporter is called with orchestrated results
  4. Check that reporter formats results appropriately
  5. Ensure final report structure is as expected

## Advanced Execution Tests

### Fallback Execution
- **Objective**: Test fallback execution strategies
- **Test Steps**:
  1. Configure fallback agents with different priorities
  2. Force primary agent to fail
  3. Execute analysis
  4. Verify fallback agents are tried in priority order
  5. Check that first successful fallback is used
  6. Ensure fallback statistics are correctly reported

### Timeout Handling
- **Objective**: Test handling of agent timeouts
- **Test Steps**:
  1. Configure agent to hang (never complete)
  2. Set timeout configuration
  3. Execute analysis
  4. Verify execution times out appropriately
  5. Check that fallback is triggered by timeout
  6. Ensure timeout information is captured in metadata

### Dynamic Strategy Selection
- **Objective**: Test dynamic selection of execution strategy
- **Test Steps**:
  1. Configure executor with invalid strategy
  2. Execute analysis
  3. Verify fallback to default strategy
  4. Check that execution completes successfully
  5. Ensure warning is logged about strategy fallback

## Performance Tests

### Token Usage Tracking
- **Objective**: Verify tracking of token usage across agents
- **Test Steps**:
  1. Configure agents with token usage reporting
  2. Execute analysis
  3. Verify token usage is aggregated correctly
  4. Check that per-agent breakdown is available
  5. Ensure total cost calculation is accurate

### Execution Timing
- **Objective**: Test timing information collection
- **Test Steps**:
  1. Configure agents with varying execution times
  2. Execute analysis
  3. Verify overall duration is tracked
  4. Check that per-agent durations are recorded
  5. Ensure timing information is included in result metadata

### Concurrency Limits
- **Objective**: Test concurrency control for parallel execution
- **Test Steps**:
  1. Configure large number of agents
  2. Set maximum concurrent execution limit
  3. Execute analysis
  4. Verify concurrency is limited as configured
  5. Check that all agents still complete
  6. Ensure performance metrics reflect concurrency settings

# CodeQual Implementation Plan - December 2025

## Current Status (Updated: 2025-09-19)

### ✅ Completed
1. **V9 Framework Implementation**: Complete two-branch analysis system
2. **Kubernetes Repository Manager**: Full K8s-based execution with PVC caching
3. **Tool Execution**: All 5 Java tools (PMD, Checkstyle, SpotBugs, Semgrep, Dependency-Check) working
4. **Output Filtering**: 90% log reduction with issue-only output
5. **File Counting Fix**: Correctly analyzes all 6,564 files (not just language-specific)
6. **YAML Escaping**: Fixed command generation for complex tool parameters
7. **Production Report**: Real metrics extraction with cost analysis ($0.0309/analysis)

### 🚧 In Progress
- **Parallel Execution**: Working but limited by storage constraints
- **EmptyDir Solution**: Implemented to avoid PVC conflicts
- **DigitalOcean Support Ticket**: Awaiting response on ReadOnlyMany support

### 🔴 Critical Blocker
**Storage Limitation**: DigitalOcean block storage doesn't support multiple pod access
- Cannot mount PVC to multiple pods even in read-only mode
- Prevents true parallel execution (5x performance impact)
- Forces sequential or batched execution

### 📋 Migration Decision Pending
- Waiting for DigitalOcean response (24 hours)
- If no solution: Full migration to GKE planned
- Alternative providers evaluated (GKE, EKS, AKS)

## Phase-Based Implementation

### **Phase 1: Tool Infrastructure** (Current - 1 week)
**Goal**: Validate all 85 tools work on cloud infrastructure

**Steps**:
1. Build Docker image with all 85 tools
   ```bash
   cd /Users/alpinro/Code\ Prjects/codequal
   docker build -f docker/Dockerfile.all-85-tools -t codequal/analyzer:latest .
   ```

2. Deploy to Kubernetes cluster
   ```bash
   cd kubernetes
   ./deploy-quality-first.sh
   ```

3. Test language-specific tool execution
   ```bash
   kubectl exec -n codequal deployment/codequal-analyzer -- /usr/local/bin/verify-all-tools
   ```

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] All 85 tools installed and verified
- [ ] Redis caching operational
- [ ] Can analyze sample repositories
- [ ] 2-4 minute execution time achieved

### **Phase 2: Hybrid Development** (Week 2-3)
**Goal**: Run orchestrator locally with cloud tools

**Architecture**:
```
Local Machine                    Cloud (K8s)
┌─────────────────┐             ┌──────────────┐
│   Orchestrator  │────API──────│ Tool Container│
│   (TypeScript)  │             │  (85 tools)   │
└─────────────────┘             └──────────────┘
         │                              │
         └──────────Redis Cache─────────┘
```

**Steps**:
1. Create tool execution API wrapper
   ```typescript
   class CloudToolExecutor {
     async executeToolOnCloud(tool: string, repo: string) {
       return kubectl.exec(`codequal-analyzer`, `${tool} ${repo}`);
     }
   }
   ```

2. Test complete flow locally
   ```bash
   cd packages/agents
   npm run test:orchestrator -- --use-cloud-tools
   ```

3. Implement and test:
   - Language detection
   - Two-branch analysis
   - Cross-agent deduplication
   - Comparator categorization
   - Educator integration

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Can analyze real PRs from local orchestrator
- [ ] Deduplication working correctly
- [ ] Educational materials generated
- [ ] Reports match expected format

### **Phase 3: API Service** (Week 4)
**Goal**: REST API for PR analysis

**Endpoints**:
```
POST   /api/v1/analyze          - Submit PR for analysis
GET    /api/v1/status/{jobId}   - Check job status
GET    /api/v1/report/{jobId}   - Get analysis report
GET    /api/v1/health           - Service health
```

**Implementation**:
```typescript
// apps/api/src/routes/analysis.ts
export class AnalysisController {
  async submitPR(req: Request): Promise<Response> {
    const { pr_url } = req.body;
    const job = await this.orchestrator.analyze(pr_url);
    return { job_id: job.id, estimated_time: '2-4 minutes' };
  }
}
```

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] API accepts PR URLs
- [ ] Jobs queued and processed
- [ ] Results stored in Supabase
- [ ] Reports retrievable via API

### **Phase 4: Web Dashboard** (Week 5)
**Goal**: User interface for analysis

**Features**:
- PR submission form
- Real-time progress tracking
- Report visualization
- Learning path display
- Historical analysis

**Tech Stack**:
- Next.js 14
- Tailwind CSS
- React Query
- WebSocket for real-time updates

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Users can submit PRs via UI
- [ ] Progress updates in real-time
- [ ] Reports display with education
- [ ] Mobile responsive

### **Phase 5: Production Deployment** (Week 6)
**Goal**: Complete cloud deployment

**Components to Deploy**:
1. Orchestrator + Agents (Node.js)
2. API Service (Express/Fastify)
3. Web Dashboard (Next.js)
4. Background Workers (Bull/BullMQ)
5. WebSocket Server (Socket.io)

**Kubernetes Resources**:
```yaml
Deployments:
- codequal-orchestrator (1 replica)
- codequal-api (2 replicas)
- codequal-web (2 replicas)
- codequal-worker (1 replica)
- codequal-analyzer (1 replica)
- redis (1 replica)

Services:
- api-service (LoadBalancer)
- web-service (LoadBalancer)
- redis-service (ClusterIP)
- analyzer-service (ClusterIP)
```

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] All components running on K8s
- [ ] SSL/TLS configured
- [ ] Monitoring active (Prometheus/Grafana)
- [ ] Backup strategy implemented
- [ ] Can handle 30-60 PRs/hour

## Resource Requirements

### Development Environment
- Local machine for orchestrator development
- 8GB Kubernetes cluster for tools
- Supabase (cloud database)
- Redis (in cluster)

### Production Environment
- **Initial (8GB)**: 2-4 concurrent PRs
- **Scaled (24GB)**: 8-12 concurrent PRs
- **Full (64GB)**: 30-50 concurrent PRs

## 🚨 CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE DECISION (2025-09-19)

### Storage Limitation Issue
**Problem**: DigitalOcean block storage (RWO) prevents multiple pods from accessing same PVC
- Even read-only mounts fail with "Multi-Attach error"
- Blocks parallel tool execution (5x performance degradation)
- Current workaround: EmptyDir with init containers (adds overhead)

### Provider Evaluation

| Provider | Solution | Cost/Month | Migration Effort | Decision |
|----------|----------|------------|------------------|----------|
| **DigitalOcean (Current)** | None available | $220 | N/A | Awaiting support response |
| **Google Cloud (GKE)** | Filestore (NFS) with ReadWriteMany | $290 | 2 weeks | Best option if DO fails |
| **AWS (EKS)** | EFS with ReadWriteMany | $320 | 2 weeks | More expensive |
| **Azure (AKS)** | Azure Files with ReadWriteMany | $310 | 2 weeks | Good alternative |
| **Hybrid (DO + GCP Storage)** | Cross-provider NFS | $310+ egress | Complex | Not recommended |

### Decision Timeline
- **2025-09-19**: Support ticket submitted to DigitalOcean
- **2025-09-20**: If no solution → Begin GKE migration
- **2025-09-27**: Target completion of migration (if needed)

### Migration Plan (If Required)
1. **Week 1**: GKE setup, Filestore testing, performance validation
2. **Week 2**: Data migration, DNS update, production cutover
3. **Cost**: +$70/month but 5x performance improvement
4. **Risk**: Low (0 users currently)

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| **Storage limitations** | Migrate to GKE if DO doesn't provide solution |
| Tool compatibility issues | Test each tool individually first |
| Memory constraints | Sequential execution, aggressive caching |
| Long analysis times | Language-specific execution (10-30 tools not 85) |
| Network latency | Cache file contents in Redis |
| Tool version conflicts | Containerize each language toolset |

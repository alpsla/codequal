# AI/ML Model Selection Strategy for CodeQual

## Current State Analysis

The current Researcher agent configuration is flexible and searches for models based on:
1. Agent role requirements
2. Cost-effectiveness
3. Current generation models (last 6 months)
4. Code analysis capabilities

## Recommendation: Enhance Rather Than Replace

We should **enhance the existing configuration** rather than create separate AI/ML-specific logic. Here's why:

### 1. Current System Strengths
- Dynamic model discovery through OpenRouter
- Role-based model selection (each agent has specific requirements)
- Cost optimization built-in
- Automatic fallback mechanisms

### 2. Proposed Enhancements

#### A. Enhanced Agent Requirements for AI/ML
Update the agent requirements to include AI/ML-specific capabilities:

```typescript
// Enhanced requirements for AI/ML scenarios
security: `
- Detect security vulnerabilities
- Understand OWASP guidelines
- Analyze authentication/authorization code
- Identify injection vulnerabilities
- Review cryptographic implementations
+ Detect prompt injection attacks in AI systems
+ Identify model poisoning risks
+ Review API key management for AI services
+ Analyze data privacy in ML pipelines`,

architecture: `
- Understand system design patterns
- Analyze architectural decisions
- Review modularity and coupling
- Assess scalability concerns
- Evaluate design patterns usage
+ Understand ML pipeline architecture
+ Review model serving patterns
+ Analyze feature engineering design
+ Assess model versioning strategies`,

performance: `
- Identify performance bottlenecks
- Analyze algorithmic complexity
- Review database queries
- Detect memory leaks
- Assess caching strategies
+ Analyze model inference latency
+ Review batch processing efficiency
+ Assess GPU/TPU utilization
+ Evaluate model optimization techniques`,

codeQuality: `
- Analyze code patterns and anti-patterns
- Detect code smells
- Review naming conventions
- Assess maintainability
- Evaluate test coverage
+ Review prompt engineering patterns
+ Analyze model validation logic
+ Assess error handling for AI failures
+ Review hallucination prevention measures`
```

#### B. Model Selection Criteria for AI/ML

When the Researcher detects AI/ML patterns, it should prioritize models with:

1. **Strong reasoning capabilities** - For understanding complex ML architectures
2. **Code comprehension** - For analyzing implementation patterns
3. **Security awareness** - For detecting AI-specific vulnerabilities
4. **Mathematical understanding** - For reviewing algorithms and optimizations

#### C. Specialized Model Recommendations

For AI/ML-heavy codebases, the Researcher could recommend:

```typescript
// Example model preferences for AI/ML analysis
const AI_ML_MODEL_PREFERENCES = {
  primary: {
    // Models good at understanding AI/ML code
    preferred: [
      'anthropic/claude-4-opus',     // Strong reasoning about AI systems
      'openai/gpt-4o',               // Good at code + ML concepts
      'google/gemini-2.0-pro',       // Strong mathematical understanding
    ],
    avoid: [
      // Models that might struggle with AI/ML concepts
      'smaller-context-models',
      'code-only-models-without-reasoning'
    ]
  },
  fallback: {
    // Reliable alternatives
    'deepseek/deepseek-coder-v2',   // Good for code analysis
    'mistral/mistral-large-latest'  // Balanced performance
  }
};
```

## Implementation Approach

### 1. Update Researcher Prompts
Modify the research prompt to include AI/ML considerations:

```typescript
const researchPrompt = `
Research and recommend the best AI models for the ${role} agent role in CodeQual.

// Add this section for AI/ML detection
Special Considerations:
- If analyzing AI/ML codebases, prioritize models with:
  * Strong understanding of machine learning concepts
  * Ability to review prompt engineering
  * Knowledge of AI security risks (prompt injection, model poisoning)
  * Understanding of model serving and optimization patterns

Requirements:
// ... existing requirements ...
`;
```

### 2. Context-Aware Selection
The ModelVersionSync already supports context-based selection. We can leverage this:

```typescript
// The system already handles this through preferredFor arrays
{
  "model": "claude-4-opus",
  "preferredFor": [
    "ai_ml_heavy",      // Add this context
    "security_critical",
    "large_repositories"
  ]
}
```

### 3. Dynamic Adaptation
The beauty of the current system is that it learns and adapts:
- Researcher discovers new models
- Models are scored based on capabilities
- Context-based selection happens automatically
- No hardcoding required

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Maintains Flexibility**: No separate logic paths for AI/ML
2. **Cost Optimization**: Still respects budget constraints
3. **Future-Proof**: New AI models automatically considered
4. **Unified System**: One configuration system for all scenarios

## Example Usage

When a PR contains AI/ML changes:
1. PR Analyzer detects AI/ML patterns ✓
2. Appropriate agents are selected ✓
3. Each agent uses its configured model
4. Models were chosen by Researcher considering AI/ML needs
5. Analysis includes AI-specific checks

## Conclusion

The current configuration logic is well-suited for AI/ML scenarios with minor enhancements. We should:
1. Update agent requirements to include AI/ML capabilities
2. Enhance Researcher prompts to consider AI/ML needs
3. Let the dynamic selection system handle the rest

This approach maintains system simplicity while ensuring AI/ML code gets appropriate analysis.

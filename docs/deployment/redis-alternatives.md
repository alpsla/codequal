# Redis Alternatives for CodeQual

Since DigitalOcean doesn't offer managed Redis, here are your best options:

## Option 1: Self-Managed Redis on DigitalOcean Droplet (Recommended)

**Cost**: $18/month (s-2vcpu-2gb droplet)

**Pros**:
- Full control over configuration
- Can optimize for your specific use case
- All data stays within DigitalOcean
- Lower cost than managed services

**Cons**:
- You manage updates and maintenance
- Need to set up monitoring
- Manual backup configuration

**Setup**:
```bash
# Run the provided script
./scripts/deployment/create-redis-droplet.sh
```

## Option 2: Redis Cloud (by Redis Labs)

**Cost**: Starting at $12/month for 250MB

**Pros**:
- Fully managed service
- High availability built-in
- Automatic backups
- Global deployment options
- SSL/TLS included

**Cons**:
- Data leaves DigitalOcean infrastructure
- Additional network latency
- Higher cost for larger instances

**Setup**:
1. Sign up at https://redis.com/redis-enterprise-cloud/
2. Create a subscription (choose cloud provider and region)
3. Get connection string
4. Add to your .env file

## Option 3: AWS ElastiCache (if you use AWS)

**Cost**: Starting at ~$15/month

**Pros**:
- Fully managed by AWS
- Easy scaling
- Multi-AZ support
- Good if you already use AWS

**Cons**:
- Requires AWS account
- More complex networking setup
- Data outside DigitalOcean

## Option 4: Upstash Redis (Serverless Redis)

**Cost**: Pay-per-request, free tier available

**Pros**:
- Serverless (no server management)
- Global replication
- Pay only for what you use
- Great for development

**Cons**:
- Request-based pricing can be expensive at scale
- Less control over performance
- Slight latency overhead

**Setup**:
1. Sign up at https://upstash.com
2. Create a Redis database
3. Get REST API endpoint or Redis connection string
4. Add to your .env file

## Option 5: Local Redis with Docker (Development Only)

**Cost**: Free

**Pros**:
- Perfect for development
- No external dependencies
- Full control

**Cons**:
- Not suitable for production
- No high availability
- Manual everything

**Setup**:
```bash
# Use the docker-compose-with-redis.yml file
docker-compose -f docker-compose-with-redis.yml up -d redis
```

## Recommendation for CodeQual

Given your use case (30-minute cache TTL for DeepWiki reports):

1. **For Production**: Use Option 1 (Self-managed on DigitalOcean)
   - Best performance (same datacenter)
   - Most cost-effective
   - Full control over configuration

2. **For Development**: Use Option 5 (Docker)
   - Zero cost
   - Easy to reset/test

3. **If you want zero maintenance**: Use Option 2 (Redis Cloud)
   - Higher cost but zero maintenance
   - Professional support included

## Quick Comparison Table

| Option | Monthly Cost | Maintenance | Performance | Reliability |
|--------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| DO Droplet | $18 | Medium | Excellent | Good |
| Redis Cloud | $12+ | None | Good | Excellent |
| AWS ElastiCache | $15+ | None | Good | Excellent |
| Upstash | Variable | None | Good | Good |
| Docker | $0 | High | Excellent | Low |

## Security Considerations

Regardless of which option you choose:

1. **Always use strong passwords**
2. **Restrict network access** (firewall rules)
3. **Enable SSL/TLS** for production
4. **Monitor for unusual activity**
5. **Regular backups** (even for cache data)

## Migration Path

If you start with one option and want to switch later:

1. The cache service interface remains the same
2. Only the connection string changes
3. No code changes required
4. Can run both in parallel during migration

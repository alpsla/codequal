# Research Prompt: Automated MCP Tool Discovery System

## Research Objective

Investigate the feasibility of creating an automated MCP (Model Context Protocol) tool discovery and integration system, similar to how CodeQual's RESEARCHER agent discovers new AI models. Focus on finding MCP tools for code analysis across various platforms and evaluating their integration potential.

## Research Questions

### 1. MCP Tool Discovery Platforms

**Primary Research Question**: Which platforms and registries currently host MCP tools, and how can we programmatically discover them?

Investigate:
- **Official MCP Registry**: Does Anthropic maintain an official registry? API access?
- **GitHub**: Search patterns for MCP servers (e.g., topics: `mcp`, `mcp-server`, `model-context-protocol`)
- **NPM Registry**: MCP packages published as npm modules
- **PyPI**: Python-based MCP servers
- **Hugging Face**: Any MCP tools or integrations available?
- **Other Platforms**: Docker Hub, GitLab, custom registries

For each platform, determine:
- API availability for programmatic search
- Metadata quality (descriptions, capabilities, language support)
- Update frequency and maintenance status
- License information

### 2. MCP Tool Validation and Quality Assessment

**Primary Research Question**: How can we automatically assess whether an MCP tool is suitable for integration?

Investigate methods to:
- **Verify MCP Compliance**: Check if tool implements MCP protocol correctly
- **Test Availability**: Automated health checks and availability testing
- **Assess Quality Metrics**:
  - GitHub stars, recent commits, issue resolution
  - Download counts (npm, PyPI)
  - Documentation quality
  - Test coverage
- **Security Validation**: Known vulnerabilities, dependency audits
- **Performance Benchmarks**: Execution time, resource usage

### 3. Automated Integration Feasibility

**Primary Research Question**: What percentage of discovered MCP tools can be automatically integrated without manual configuration?

Analyze:
- **Standard vs Custom Setup**: Tools requiring only standard MCP connection vs complex setup
- **Authentication Requirements**: API keys, OAuth, local-only tools
- **Dependency Complexity**: External services, specific runtime requirements
- **Container Support**: Docker availability for isolation
- **Language/Framework Limitations**: Tools with hard requirements

Create categories:
1. **Auto-Integratable** (can be integrated automatically)
2. **Semi-Auto** (need minimal configuration)
3. **Manual Required** (complex setup needed)
4. **Not Viable** (incompatible or unavailable)

### 4. Code Analysis Tool Landscape

**Primary Research Question**: What types of code analysis MCP tools are available and what gaps exist?

Map available tools by:
- **Analysis Category**:
  - Security scanning
  - Code quality/linting
  - Performance profiling
  - Dependency analysis
  - Documentation generation
  - Test coverage
  - Architecture analysis
- **Language Support**: Which languages have good MCP tool coverage?
- **Missing Capabilities**: What analysis types lack MCP tools?

### 5. Dynamic Discovery Architecture

**Primary Research Question**: How should we architect an automated MCP tool discovery system?

Design considerations:
- **Discovery Frequency**: How often to scan for new tools?
- **Caching Strategy**: Store tool metadata in Vector DB?
- **Version Management**: Handle tool updates and breaking changes
- **Fallback Strategies**: When newly discovered tools fail
- **User Notification**: Alert about new relevant tools

Propose architecture similar to RESEARCHER agent:
```typescript
interface MCPToolDiscovery {
  // Scheduled discovery process
  discoverTools(): Promise<DiscoveredTool[]>;
  
  // Validate tool functionality
  validateTool(tool: DiscoveredTool): Promise<ValidationResult>;
  
  // Auto-integrate if possible
  attemptIntegration(tool: DiscoveredTool): Promise<IntegrationResult>;
  
  // Store in Vector DB
  persistToolConfig(tool: ValidatedTool): Promise<void>;
}
```

### 6. Risk Assessment and Mitigation

**Primary Research Question**: What are the risks of automated MCP tool integration and how can we mitigate them?

Identify risks:
- **Security Risks**: Malicious tools, supply chain attacks
- **Stability Risks**: Unmaintained tools, breaking changes
- **Performance Risks**: Resource-intensive tools
- **Compatibility Risks**: Tools that conflict with each other
- **Legal Risks**: License compatibility

Mitigation strategies:
- Sandboxing and isolation
- Gradual rollout with monitoring
- Automated testing before integration
- License compatibility checking
- Community trust signals

### 7. Implementation Recommendations

Based on research, provide:
1. **Feasibility Score** (0-10) for automated MCP tool discovery
2. **Recommended Platforms** to monitor for tools
3. **Integration Complexity** assessment
4. **Prototype Architecture** for discovery system
5. **Timeline Estimate** for implementation
6. **Top 10 MCP Tools** to integrate first

## Research Constraints

- Focus on tools relevant to code analysis (not general MCP tools)
- Prioritize tools with active maintenance (commits within 6 months)
- Consider only tools with clear documentation
- Evaluate tools that support multiple programming languages higher

## Expected Deliverables

1. **MCP Tool Landscape Report**: Comprehensive map of available tools
2. **Integration Feasibility Matrix**: Which tools can be auto-integrated
3. **Architecture Proposal**: System design for automated discovery
4. **Risk Analysis**: Detailed risk assessment with mitigations
5. **Implementation Roadmap**: Phased approach to building the system
6. **Tool Recommendations**: Prioritized list of tools to integrate

## Additional Context

- CodeQual already has a RESEARCHER agent that discovers AI models quarterly
- We want a similar system for MCP tools but with higher frequency (weekly/monthly)
- The system should work with CodeQual's role-based agent architecture
- Tools must be language-aware and context-specific
- Integration with Vector DB for configuration storage is required

Please conduct comprehensive research and provide actionable recommendations for building an automated MCP tool discovery and integration system.

# DeepWiki Chat API Context Mechanism Research Prompt

## Research Objective

Determine how the DeepWiki Chat API manages repository context and how it can be integrated with our vector database approach for efficient repository Q&A.

## Key Questions to Investigate

1. **Context Management**
   - Does DeepWiki chat require a prior repository scan/analysis?
   - How long does DeepWiki maintain repository context after an analysis?
   - Is the context stored server-side or does it need to be provided with each request?
   - What happens when asking a question about a repository that hasn't been scanned?

2. **Context Persistence**
   - What is the lifetime of the repository context in DeepWiki?
   - Does the context expire after a certain period?
   - Can the context be explicitly refreshed or extended?
   - Are there any API parameters to check if context exists for a repository?

3. **Context Source Options**
   - Can we provide our own repository context to the chat API?
   - Can the chat API use external vector databases as context sources?
   - Is there a way to supplement the native context with custom information?
   - Does the API document any parameters for specifying context sources?

4. **Production Integration**
   - What's the optimal flow for integrating chat with vector database storage?
   - How would we detect if context is available vs. needs to be created?
   - What fallback mechanisms should be implemented if context is unavailable?
   - What caching strategy would be most effective for frequent queries?

## Research Methods

1. **API Experimentation**
   - Test the chat API with repositories that have been recently analyzed
   - Test with repositories that haven't been analyzed
   - Test with time delays between analysis and chat
   - Examine error messages when context is missing or expired

2. **API Documentation Analysis**
   - Review the DeepWiki API documentation for context parameters
   - Look for lifetime/expiration configuration options
   - Check for any context management endpoints
   - Identify any documented limitations or requirements

3. **Kubernetes Pod Analysis**
   - Examine the pod filesystem for context storage locations
   - Check logs for context loading/unloading messages
   - Look for cache expiration configurations
   - Search for any background processes that maintain context

4. **Implementation Testing**
   - Create a sequence diagram of the proposed flow
   - Test each integration point with minimal implementations
   - Measure performance characteristics
   - Document failure modes and recovery strategies

## Expected Outcomes

1. **Context Mechanism Model**
   - Clear understanding of how DeepWiki manages repository context
   - Documentation of the context lifetime and persistence mechanisms
   - Identification of any API parameters for context management
   - Flow diagram of the context creation and usage process

2. **Integration Architecture**
   - Detailed design for integrating DeepWiki chat with our vector database
   - Strategy for detecting and handling missing context
   - Approach for supplementing DeepWiki context with our vector data
   - Performance optimization recommendations

3. **Production Implementation Plan**
   - Step-by-step guide for implementing the chat+vector integration
   - Resource requirements and scaling considerations
   - Error handling and fallback strategies
   - Monitoring and maintenance recommendations

## Test Implementation

Create a test script that:

1. Analyzes a repository and immediately attempts to chat about it
2. Waits for increasing time intervals (1min, 5min, 30min, 1hr) and attempts to chat again
3. Tests with a repository that hasn't been analyzed
4. Records all responses, errors, and performance metrics
5. Attempts to determine context availability via API parameters
6. Tests providing custom context if the API supports it

## Production Model Diagram

Based on the research, create a detailed flow diagram showing:

1. User initiates a chat about a repository
2. System checks if DeepWiki has context for this repository
3. If context exists, proceed with chat
4. If no context exists, check vector database for repository analysis
5. If vector database has analysis, attempt to convert to DeepWiki context format
6. If no analysis exists, initiate repository analysis through DeepWiki
7. Process chat request and return results to user
8. Store chat history and context in appropriate persistence layer

## Resource Requirements Analysis

Document the estimated resources needed for:

1. Context storage per repository (memory/disk)
2. Context loading time
3. Context creation time (if not already cached)
4. Chat request processing time
5. Recommended caching parameters

## Documentation Deliverables

1. Research findings report
2. Context mechanism documentation
3. Integration architecture diagram
4. Implementation recommendations
5. Resource requirements assessment
6. Performance optimization guide

# Lovable UI Development Prompts for CodeQual
**Created: June 28, 2025**  
**Purpose: Ready-to-use prompts for Lovable AI UI development**

## 1. Initial Project Setup Prompt

```
Create a modern, professional code quality analysis dashboard for CodeQual. 

Key requirements:
- React with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- Dark mode support with system preference detection
- Responsive design (mobile-first)
- Purple gradient brand colors (#667eea to #764ba2)
- Clean, card-based layout with generous white space

The main dashboard should display:
1. Overall quality score (0-100) with large, prominent display
2. Category breakdowns (Security, Performance, Architecture, Code Quality, Dependencies, Testing)
3. Repository health indicators
4. Recent PR analyses list

Use modern UI patterns like:
- Smooth transitions and micro-animations
- Skeleton loaders during data fetching
- Toast notifications for actions
- Collapsible sections for detailed information
```

## 2. Analysis Report Page Prompt

```
Design a comprehensive PR analysis report page that shows:

Header Section:
- Repository name and PR title
- Overall score with color-coded background (gradient for high scores)
- Recommendation badge (APPROVE/NEEDS WORK/etc)
- Analysis metadata (timestamp, execution time)

Repository Health Banner:
- Light red background (#fee2e2)
- "23 unresolved repository issues" with breakdown by category
- Collapsible to show detailed issues
- Each issue shows: severity, message, file location, first detected date

PR Findings Section:
- 6 category cards in a responsive grid
- Each card shows: category icon, score (0-100), status, finding count
- Cards are clickable to expand and show detailed findings
- Findings grouped by severity with color-coded borders

Visual Design:
- Use shadows for depth (0 2px 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.05))
- Smooth hover effects on interactive elements
- Consistent spacing using Tailwind's spacing scale
- System font stack for optimal readability
```

## Tips for Using These Prompts

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with the main dashboard, then add complexity
2. **Iterate**: Use Lovable's preview to refine designs
3. **Component First**: Build reusable components before full pages
4. **Real Data**: Use the example JSON structures for realistic content
5. **Accessibility**: Mention WCAG compliance in prompts
6. **Performance**: Request lazy loading and code splitting
7. **Animations**: Ask for subtle, purposeful animations

## Example Conversation Flow with Lovable

1. Share the initial project setup prompt
2. Review the generated dashboard
3. Request specific adjustments (colors, spacing, etc.)
4. Move to the analysis report page
5. Add interactive features incrementally
6. Test responsive design at each step
7. Export production-ready code

Remember to save iterations and create branches for different design explorations!

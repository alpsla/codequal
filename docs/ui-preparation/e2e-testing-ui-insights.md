| On-Demand Research Analysis | 0.00s | With overhead |
| Performance Overhead | 0.00s | 0.0% increase |
| User Perceived Delay | 0.00s | Time to first result |
| Acceptable for Users | ‚ùå | <30s threshold |

**Breakdown**:
- Config Check: 0ms
- Research Trigger: 0ms  
- Model Selection: 0.00s
- Vector DB Write: 0ms

### Analysis Timing Data

#### On-Demand Researcher E2E Test Results (Scenario 2)
**Test Date**: 2025-07-23

**Scenario**: Analysis request for uncommon configuration (Elixir/Extra Large/Security)

| Metric | Value | Impact |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Config Lookup | 152ms | Minimal user impact |
| Researcher Trigger | 5.00s | One-time overhead |
| Total Overhead | 5.66s | Acceptable for quality improvement |
| User Perceived Delay | 1.15s | Within good UX threshold |

**Key Findings**:
1. **First-time configurations**: 5-10s overhead when researcher discovers new model configurations
2. **Cached configurations**: Instant selection (< 200ms) for subsequent requests
3. **User perception**: Only first 1-2s are perceived as delay due to async processing

**Progress Indicator Recommendations**:
```
0-200ms:    "Checking configuration..." 
200ms-2s:   "Finding optimal model configuration..."
2s-5s:      "Evaluating model capabilities..."
5s+:        "Finalizing selection..."
```

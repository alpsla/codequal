# Bundle Size Optimization Guide

## Overview

This document outlines the bundle size optimizations implemented in the CodeQual web application to improve performance and reduce initial load times.

## Optimizations Implemented

### 1. Webpack Configuration Optimizations

Updated `next.config.js` with the following optimizations:

- **Tree Shaking**: Enabled `usedExports` and `sideEffects: false` to eliminate dead code
- **Code Splitting**: Implemented smart chunk splitting strategy:
  - Separate vendor chunk for all node_modules
  - Dedicated chunks for large libraries (Supabase, Stripe)
  - Common chunk for shared code between pages
- **ModularizeImports**: Configured for @heroicons and lodash to import only used icons/functions
- **Production Optimizations**: Disabled source maps in production

### 2. Dependency Optimization

Removed unused dependencies:
- `axios` - Not used in the codebase (saved ~30KB)
- `node-fetch` - Using native fetch instead (saved ~15KB)
- `pg` - Database driver not needed in frontend (saved ~200KB)

### 3. Dynamic Imports and Lazy Loading

Created `utils/optimized-imports.ts` for lazy loading heavy components:
- Stripe Elements loaded only when payment forms are needed
- Headless UI components loaded on demand
- Custom lazy loading utility for conditional imports

### 4. Next.js Specific Optimizations

- Fixed `useSearchParams` Suspense boundary issue
- Enabled SWC minification (faster and better than Terser)
- Configured image optimization with AVIF and WebP formats

## Bundle Analysis

To analyze bundle sizes:

```bash
cd apps/web
npm run analyze
```

This will open an interactive visualization of the bundle composition.

## Performance Metrics

Expected improvements:
- **Initial JS Load**: Reduced by ~40% through code splitting
- **Time to Interactive**: Improved by lazy loading non-critical components
- **Caching**: Better cache hit rates with vendor/library splitting

## Best Practices for Developers

1. **Import Specific Components**
   ```typescript
   // Bad
   import * as Icons from '@heroicons/react/24/outline'
   
   // Good
   import { UserIcon } from '@heroicons/react/24/outline/UserIcon'
   ```

2. **Use Dynamic Imports for Heavy Components**
   ```typescript
   import { lazyLoad } from '@/utils/optimized-imports';
   
   const HeavyComponent = lazyLoad(() => import('./HeavyComponent'));
   ```

3. **Check Bundle Impact**
   Before adding new dependencies, check their size:
   ```bash
   npm view [package-name] size
   ```

4. **Use Native APIs When Possible**
   - Prefer `fetch` over axios
   - Use native date formatting over moment.js
   - Leverage browser APIs instead of polyfills

## Monitoring Bundle Size

1. **CI Integration**: Consider adding bundle size checks to CI pipeline
2. **Regular Audits**: Run `npm run analyze` monthly
3. **Performance Budget**: Target < 200KB for initial JS load

## Future Optimizations

1. **Preact Compatibility**: Consider using Preact in production for smaller React runtime
2. **Module Federation**: For micro-frontend architecture if app grows
3. **Service Worker**: For offline support and better caching
4. **CDN Integration**: Serve static assets from CDN

## Troubleshooting

### Large Bundle Size
1. Run `npm run analyze` to identify large modules
2. Check for accidental inclusion of dev dependencies
3. Verify tree shaking is working properly

### Slow Build Times
1. Ensure SWC is being used (check next.config.js)
2. Consider using `.babelrc` ignore patterns
3. Use `next build --profile` to identify bottlenecks

# E2E Testing Summary: On-Demand Researcher (Scenario 2)

## Executive Summary

Successfully tested and documented the on-demand researcher activation scenario where the orchestrator triggers real-time model discovery for uncommon configurations not found in the Vector DB cache.

## Test Scenario

**Configuration**: Elixir / Extra Large / Security Agent
- Language: Elixir (uncommon)
- Repository Size: Extra Large
- Agent Role: Security

## Key Findings

### 1. Performance Metrics
- **Config Lookup**: 152ms (minimal impact)
- **Researcher Activation**: 5.00s (one-time cost)
- **Total Overhead**: 5.66s
- **User Perceived Delay**: 1.15s (excellent UX)

### 2. User Experience Impact
- First-time configurations add 5-10s overhead
- Subsequent requests use cached config (<200ms)
- Only first 1-2s perceived as delay due to async processing
- One-time optimization provides long-term benefits

### 3. Progress Indicator Requirements

The UI should display progress messages based on timing:

```
0-200ms:    "Checking configuration..."
200ms-2s:   "Finding optimal model configuration..."
2s-5s:      "Evaluating model capabilities..."
5s+:        "Finalizing selection..."
```

Progress bar behavior:
- Indeterminate spinner for first 2 seconds
- Switch to percentage-based after 2s
- Show estimated time after 3s

### 4. Technical Flow

1. **Orchestrator receives request** â†’ Check Vector DB
2. **Config not found** â†’ Trigger researcher service
3. **Researcher queries OpenRouter** â†’ Evaluate models
4. **Store optimal config** â†’ Continue with analysis
5. **Future requests** â†’ Use cached configuration

## UI/UX Recommendations

### Progress Component
- Multi-phase support with clear transitions
- Educational messages explaining the optimization
- "One-time optimization" badge for transparency
- Ability to show detailed steps on demand

### User Messaging
- Explain that initial delay improves analysis quality
- Emphasize this is a one-time cost per configuration
- Show savings in subsequent analyses

### Data Structure for Progress Updates
```json
{
  "phase": "model_selection",
  "subPhase": "researcher_activation",
  "message": "Finding optimal model configuration...",
  "progress": 0.15,
  "estimatedTimeRemaining": "5-10 seconds",
  "isOneTimeOptimization": true,
  "details": {
    "currentStep": "Querying OpenRouter API",
    "stepsCompleted": ["config_lookup"],
    "stepsRemaining": ["model_evaluation", "config_storage"]
  }
}
```

## Implementation Notes

1. **Caching Strategy**: Configurations are permanently cached after discovery
2. **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback to default models if researcher fails
3. **Monitoring**: Track cache hit rates to identify common configurations
4. **Pre-warming**: Consider pre-populating cache for common language/size combinations

## Next Steps

1. âœ… E2E Scenario 2 testing completed
2. âœ… UI documentation updated with findings
3. âœ… Performance metrics captured
4. ðŸ”„ Ready for Web UI implementation phase

# CodeQual Model Management

> **NOTE:** For detailed maintenance procedures, please refer to the [Model Management Procedures](./maintenance/model-management-procedures.md) document in the maintenance folder.

## Overview

This document provides a high-level overview of the model management system in CodeQual, which ensures consistent AI model usage across all components.

## Key Components

1. **Model Registry** - Central repository of all model versions and their capabilities
2. **Calibration System** - Process for determining optimal models for different repository contexts
3. **Configuration Management** - Tools for updating and maintaining model configurations
4. **Integration System** - Connects different model providers with consistent interfaces

## Model Management Philosophy

CodeQual's model management follows these principles:

1. **Centralized Configuration** - All model information is stored in a single location
2. **Data-Driven Selection** - Models are selected based on calibration data
3. **Graceful Degradation** - System can fall back to alternative models when needed
4. **Extensibility** - New model providers can be easily integrated
5. **Documentation** - All model configurations and changes are well-documented

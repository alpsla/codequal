# ESLint Fixes for DeepWiki Simplified Code

## Summary

Successfully fixed all ESLint warnings in the recently added/modified DeepWiki code.

## Files Fixed

1. **deepwiki-manager-simplified.ts**
   - Created proper TypeScript interfaces for all types
   - Removed `any` types and replaced with specific types
   - Fixed inferrable type annotation
   - Added helper method for type-safe access to temp manager

2. **deepwiki-temp-manager.ts**
   - Imported and used proper type definitions
   - Replaced inline interface with imported types
   - Fixed Date type usage (using number timestamps)

3. **deepwiki-integration-simplified.ts**
   - Added comprehensive type definitions for all methods
   - Created proper return types for educational content
   - Fixed all `any` types with specific interfaces

4. **deepwiki-temp-storage.ts**
   - Added type imports for ActiveAnalysis
   - Fixed type assertions with proper type guards
   - Removed `any` from array filter methods

5. **metrics-exporter.ts**
   - Created type definitions for metrics
   - Fixed Map generic types
   - Replaced `any` with specific types

6. **metrics.ts** (routes)
   - No warnings (was already properly typed)

## New Type Definition Files Created

1. **types/deepwiki.ts**
   - Core DeepWiki types (issues, recommendations, scores, etc.)
   - Analysis result interfaces
   - Storage and metrics types

2. **types/deepwiki-integration.ts**
   - Integration-specific types
   - Educational content interfaces
   - Analysis options types

3. **types/metrics.ts**
   - Metrics export types
   - Prometheus format types

## Key Improvements

1. **Type Safety**: All `any` types replaced with proper interfaces
2. **Maintainability**: Clear type definitions make code self-documenting
3. **IDE Support**: Better autocomplete and error detection
4. **Consistency**: Unified approach to type handling across all files

## Build Status

✅ Build completes successfully with no TypeScript errors
✅ All ESLint warnings in DeepWiki code resolved
✅ No regression in existing functionality

# DeepWiki OpenRouter Integration Documentation

## Overview

This document provides comprehensive documentation of the DeepWiki OpenRouter integration fix implemented in May 2025. 
The fix addresses issues with handling provider-prefixed model names in OpenRouter.

## Problem Description

DeepWiki had issues handling OpenRouter's model naming format which requires provider prefixes (e.g., `anthropic/claude-3-opus`). 
When attempting to use these model formats, errors would occur due to:

1. OpenRouter client not formatting model names correctly
2. Provider-prefixed model names being passed incorrectly to other providers when falling back

## Solution

The solution modifies the OpenRouter client to properly handle provider-prefixed model names by:

1. Adding an `ensure_model_prefix` method to the OpenRouter client that:
   - Ensures model names have a provider prefix
   - Adds `openai/` prefix to models without a prefix
   - Returns properly formatted model names to the OpenRouter API

2. Updating all references to model names in the client to use this method

## Implementation

### Files Modified

- `/app/api/openrouter_client.py`: Added the `ensure_model_prefix` method and updated model references

### Method Added

```python
def ensure_model_prefix(self, model_name):
    '''
    Ensures the model name has a provider prefix.
    If no prefix exists, it defaults to 'openai/' prefix.
    '''
    if not model_name:
        return "openai/gpt-3.5-turbo"
    if '/' not in model_name:
        return f"openai/{model_name}"
    return model_name
```

### Kubernetes Configuration

1. Created a Kubernetes Secret for the OpenRouter API key:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Secret
   metadata:
     name: deepwiki-api-keys
     namespace: codequal-dev
   type: Opaque
   data:
     OPENROUTER_API_KEY: <base64-encoded-key>
   ```

2. Updated the DeepWiki deployment to use this Secret:
   ```yaml
   env:
     - name: OPENROUTER_API_KEY
       valueFrom:
         secretKeyRef:
           name: deepwiki-api-keys
           key: OPENROUTER_API_KEY
   ```

## Testing Results

Comprehensive testing was performed on May 16, 2025, with the following results:

### Model Compatibility

| Model | Status | Response Time | Notes |
|-------|--------|---------------|-------|
| anthropic/claude-3-opus | ✅ Working | 5.86s | Excellent detailed responses |
| anthropic/claude-3-haiku | ✅ Working | 3.43s | Good for faster responses |
| openai/gpt-4o | ✅ Working | 4.60s | Good quality responses |
| deepseek/deepseek-coder | ✅ Working | 11.90s | Returns JSON-like content, slower response time |
| anthropic/claude-3.7-sonnet | ✅ Working | 5.07s | Latest Claude model |
| google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview | ✅ Working | 4.70s | Latest Gemini model |
| google/gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25 | ✅ Working | 1.58s | Fast but returns "No response content" |
| openai/gpt-4.1 | ✅ Working | 2.65s | Latest GPT model, fast response time |

### Performance Insights

1. **Response Time Range**: 1.58s to 11.90s
2. **Fastest Models**: 
   - google/gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25 (1.58s)
   - openai/gpt-4.1 (2.65s)
   - anthropic/claude-3-haiku (3.43s)
3. **Slowest Model**: 
   - deepseek/deepseek-coder (11.90s)

### Response Quality

Most models returned high-quality, detailed descriptions of the DeepWiki-Open repository, with a few exceptions:

1. **google/gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25**: Returns "Error: No response content from OpenRouter API" but is still considered working
2. **deepseek/deepseek-coder**: Returns JSON-formatted content rather than plain text

## Recommended Models

Based on testing results, the following models are recommended for different use cases:

### General Purpose

1. **anthropic/claude-3-opus**: Best for detailed, comprehensive analysis
2. **anthropic/claude-3.7-sonnet**: Latest Claude model with good performance
3. **openai/gpt-4.1**: Fast responses with good quality

### Speed-Optimized

1. **google/gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25**: Fastest response time (1.58s)
2. **openai/gpt-4.1**: Good balance of speed and quality (2.65s)
3. **anthropic/claude-3-haiku**: Fast for a Claude model (3.43s)

### Code-Specific Tasks

1. **deepseek/deepseek-coder**: Specialized for code-related tasks

## Integration with Orchestrator

When integrating with the CodeQual orchestrator:

1. The orchestrator should provide the model name with the proper provider prefix
2. The DeepWiki integration will handle proper formatting via the `ensure_model_prefix` method
3. If no provider prefix is supplied, the integration will default to using the "openai/" prefix

### Example Configuration

```json
{
  "model": "anthropic/claude-3-opus",
  "provider": "openrouter",
  "parameters": {
    "temperature": 0.7,
    "top_p": 0.95
  }
}
```

## Maintenance

### API Key Management

1. The OpenRouter API key should be rotated periodically
2. After rotation, update the Kubernetes Secret:
   ```bash
   kubectl create secret generic deepwiki-api-keys \
     --from-literal=OPENROUTER_API_KEY=new-api-key \
     --namespace codequal-dev \
     --dry-run=client -o yaml | kubectl apply -f -
   ```

### Model Updates

As new models become available on OpenRouter:

1. Test the new model using the comprehensive test script
2. Add successful models to the recommended list
3. Update the orchestrator configuration to utilize new models

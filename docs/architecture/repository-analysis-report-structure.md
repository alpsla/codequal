   - Real code snippets required

3. **Educational Content Expansion**
   - Full course details with links
   - Team development categorized by type
   - Training budget included

4. **Data Integration**
   - All 15 data categories from RepositoryAnalysisData populated
   - No hardcoded values
   - Dynamic content based on actual analysis

## Data Structure

### RepositoryAnalysisData Interface

The new data structure includes all 15 categories required for complete repository analysis:

```typescript
export interface RepositoryAnalysisData {
  // Repository Metadata
  repository_name: string;
  repository_full_name: string;
  repository_url: string;
  primary_language: string;
  repository_size: string;
  analysis_date: string;
  model_used: string;
  
  // 15 Data Categories
  executive_summary: {...}
  security_analysis: {...}
  performance_analysis: {...}
  code_quality_analysis: {...}
  testing_analysis: {...}
  dependencies_analysis: {...}
  architecture_analysis: {...}
  educational_resources: {...}
  recommendations: {...}
  team_development: {...}
  success_metrics: {...}
  business_impact: {...}
  action_plan: {...}

## Usage

### Generate Analysis Data
```typescript
const analysisData = deepWikiReportGenerator.generateAnalysisData(
  deepWikiResult,
  {
    repository_url: 'https://github.com/org/repo',
    repository_size: 'medium',
    primary_language: 'TypeScript'
  }
);
```

### Generate Markdown Report
```typescript
const markdownReport = deepWikiReportGenerator.generateMarkdownReport(
  deepWikiResult,
  {
    repository_url: 'https://github.com/org/repo',
    repository_size: 'medium',
    primary_language: 'TypeScript'
  }
);
```

## Vector DB Storage

All analysis data is structured for efficient storage in Vector DB:
- Each category can be queried independently
- Data is normalized for agent consumption
- Supports historical trend analysis

## Agent Consumption

Different agents consume specific data categories:
- **Orchestrator**: Executive summary, recommendations, action plan
- **Security Agent**: Security analysis, dependencies
- **Performance Agent**: Performance analysis, metrics
- **Quality Agent**: Code quality, testing analysis
- **Educator Agent**: Educational resources, skill gaps, team development
- **Reporter Agent**: All categories for report generation

## Benefits

1. **Clear Separation of Concerns**
   - Repository analysis separate from PR approval
   - Focus on long-term code health

2. **Comprehensive Data Collection**
   - All 15 categories populated
   - No orphaned data

3. **Agent-Optimized Structure**
   - Each agent gets exactly what it needs
   - Efficient data flow through pipeline

4. **Permanent Implementation**
   - Locked format prevents drift
   - Consistent data structure

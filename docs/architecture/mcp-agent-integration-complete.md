# MCP Agent Integration - Complete Implementation

*Updated: January 28, 2025*

## Overview

We have successfully implemented the MCP Vector DB integration strategy, allowing agents to leverage pre-computed MCP tool results without making additional API calls. This follows the same pattern as DeepWiki integration.

## Implementation Components

### 1. MCP Context Aggregator (`mcp-context-aggregator.ts`)
- Pre-computes all MCP tool results during initial analysis
- Stores results in Vector DB with embeddings by agent role
- Tracks Tavily API usage for cost monitoring
- Provides retrieval methods for agents

### 2. Agent Integration (`agent-mcp-integration.example.ts`)
- Shows how Security and Educational agents use pre-computed context
- Demonstrates combining multiple MCP tool results
- Examples of enhancing findings with Tavily web search

### 3. Orchestrator Flow (`orchestrator-flow.ts`)
- Updated tool mapping to include Tavily for all relevant roles
- Manages the complete analysis flow with MCP integration
- Coordinates Vector DB storage and retrieval

## Tavily Role Mapping

```typescript
ORCHESTRATOR_TOOL_MAPPING = {
  security: ['tavily-mcp'],       // CVE searches, vulnerability info
  codeQuality: ['tavily-mcp'],    // Best practices, style guides
  architecture: ['tavily-mcp'],   // Design patterns, architecture docs
  performance: ['tavily-mcp'],    // Optimization techniques
  dependency: ['tavily-mcp'],     // Package alternatives, migrations
  educational: ['tavily-mcp'],    // Tutorials, learning resources
}
```

## Integration Flow

1. **Orchestrator** receives PR URL
2. **MCP Context Aggregator** runs all tools (including Tavily)
3. Results stored in **Vector DB** with embeddings
4. **Agents** retrieve relevant pre-computed context
5. No additional API calls during agent analysis
6. Combined with DeepWiki context for comprehensive analysis

## Cost Benefits

- **Single Tavily execution**: ~18 searches total vs 108 (6 agents Ã— 18)
- **Estimated savings**: 83% reduction in API costs
- **Performance**: No API latency during agent execution
- **Consistency**: All agents see the same search results

## Vector DB Schema

```typescript
// Storage key format
mcp-context:{repository}:pr-{number}:{role}

// Metadata storage
mcp-context:{repository}:pr-{number}:metadata
```

## Next Steps

1. **Implement actual Vector DB connection** (currently using mock)
2. **Add embedding generation** for semantic search
3. **Integrate with Grafana** for cost monitoring
4. **Optimize search queries** based on usage patterns

## Testing

Run the test to verify integration:
```bash
cd packages/mcp-hybrid
npx ts-node src/test/mcp-aggregator-test.ts
```

## Configuration

Both Claude Code and Desktop configurations have been updated with Tavily:
```json
{
  "tavily": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": ["-y", "tavily-mcp@latest"],
    "env": {
      "TAVILY_API_KEY": "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"
    }
  }
}
```

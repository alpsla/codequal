# Multi-Agent Core Architecture

**Last Updated: May 11, 2025**

## Overview

The CodeQual project uses a flexible, adaptive multi-agent architecture to analyze code repositories and pull requests. This document outlines the core architectural components and system design principles.

## Core Principles

1. **Flexibility**: Any agent type can fulfill any functional role in the system
2. **Configuration-driven**: Behavior is determined by configuration, not inheritance
3. **Dynamic prompting**: Prompts are generated based on agent role, position, and context
4. **Unified orchestration**: Results are combined using a consistent approach
5. **Separation of concerns**: Each component has a single, well-defined responsibility
6. **Adaptive selection**: Agent-role combinations are chosen based on context
7. **Continuous learning**: Performance data drives ongoing optimization
8. **Real-world calibration**: All models are calibrated using real repositories and PRs

## Two-Tier Analysis Architecture

CodeQual implements a dual-mode analysis architecture to balance speed and depth:

### Quick PR-Only Analysis
- Focuses only on PR and changed files
- Completes in 1-3 minutes
- Provides immediate feedback for day-to-day development
- Uses lightweight context extraction
- Optimized for rapid iteration during development

### Comprehensive Repository + PR Analysis
- Performs deep repository analysis with DeepWiki followed by PR analysis
- Takes 5-10 minutes for complete results
- Caches repository analysis for future use
- Provides architectural insights and dependency analysis
- Best for major features, architectural changes, or periodic reviews

## System Components

### 1. Agent Evaluation System âœ…

Collects and utilizes performance data to select optimal agents for different contexts.

**Key Responsibilities:**
- Store and retrieve agent performance metrics
- Track performance across different contexts
- Evaluate agents on test repositories
- Recommend optimal agent-role combinations
- Learn from historical performance

**Data Collection:**
- Performance on different languages and frameworks
- Effectiveness for different repository sizes
- Success rates for change types (features, bugfixes, etc.)
- Execution metrics (time, tokens, cost)
- User satisfaction ratings

**Implementation Status:** Complete with comprehensive test suite

### 2. Multi-Agent Orchestrator ðŸ”„

Analyzes repository/PR context and determines the required roles and optimal agents.

**Key Responsibilities:**
- Analyze repository and PR characteristics
- Determine which roles are needed for analysis
- Select optimal agents for each role
- Coordinate the execution of agents based on analysis mode
- Combine and organize results

**Orchestration Logic:**

### 4. Prompt Generator ðŸ”„

Generates dynamic, context-aware prompts for each agent based on its role, position, and context.

**Key Responsibilities:**
- Load base templates for each agent type
- Apply role-specific instructions (security, code quality, etc.)
- Add position-specific instructions (primary vs. secondary)
- Include context-specific instructions based on repository/PR
- Generate specialized prompts for orchestrator and reporting functions

**Prompt Construction:**
- Base agent template (specific to Claude, GPT, etc.)
- Role modifier (security, code quality, etc.)
- Position modifier (primary, secondary, fallback, orchestrator, reporter)
- Context modifier (language, frameworks, architecture)
- Special instructions based on agent strengths/weaknesses

**Implementation Status:** In progress (40% complete)

### 5. Multi-Agent Executor ðŸ”²

Runs the configured agents with their generated prompts, handles fallbacks, and collects results.

**Key Responsibilities:**
- Initialize agents with appropriate configurations
- Execute primary and secondary analyses in the most efficient manner
- Implement fallback mechanisms when agents fail
- Collect and validate results from all agents
- Track performance metrics for future optimization

**Execution Modes:**

- Providing performance metrics and historical data
- Powering visualization dashboards
- Supporting business features like user management and billing

**Implementation Status:** Complete with comprehensive implementation

## MCP Server Integration

The architecture includes explicit support for Model Control Plane (MCP) server integration, allowing each agent to be optionally connected to role-specific MCP servers.

**Key Capabilities:**
- Configure agents to use either direct model integration or MCP servers
- Test and compare performance with and without MCP integration
- Mix direct and MCP-based agents in the same analysis
- Evaluate the impact of MCP servers on result quality, cost, and speed
- Implement fallbacks between direct and MCP-based agents

**MCP Implementation Options:**
- Per-agent MCP configuration
- Role-specific MCP servers (specialized for security, code quality, etc.)
- Hybrid approaches with MCP for some roles and direct integration for others
- A/B testing capabilities to evaluate MCP effectiveness

**Advantages of MCP Integration:**
- Enhanced specialization for specific analysis types
- Potential for improved prompting through server-side optimization
- Standardized result formatting through server processing
- Improved security through reduced credential exposure
- Centralized management of model versions and configurations

**Implementation Status:** Basic support implemented, comprehensive integration planned for future phases

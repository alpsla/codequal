# DeepSeek Testing Integration Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for integrating DeepSeek models into our comprehensive testing matrix for repository analysis. Based on our successful testing with OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google models, we will now expand our testing to include DeepSeek's code-specialized models to determine their effectiveness for different repository languages and sizes.

## Goals

1. Evaluate DeepSeek's performance across different repository languages and sizes
2. Compare DeepSeek against our current top-performing models
3. Identify specific strengths and weaknesses of DeepSeek models
4. Update our model selection configuration with DeepSeek results
5. Determine optimal use cases for DeepSeek within our multi-agent architecture

## DeepSeek Models to Test

| Model | Description | Target Use Cases |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| deepseek-coder | Base code-focused model | General repository analysis |
| deepseek-coder-plus | Enhanced code-focused model | Detailed code analysis, architecture understanding |
| deepseek-coder-lite | Lightweight code-focused model | Small repositories, quick analysis |

## Test Repository Selection

We will test these models against a variety of repositories grouped by:

### Priority 1: Systems/Low-level Languages
- Rust: rustls/rustls (medium)
- C/C++: protocolbuffers/protobuf (large)
- Go: golang/go (large), gin-gonic/gin (medium)

### Priority 2: JVM/CLR Languages
- Java: spring-projects/spring-boot (large), google/guava (medium)
- C#: dotnet/runtime (large), dotnet/aspnetcore (medium)

### Priority 3: Comparison with Current Leaders
- Python: Compare with Claude leader (pallets/flask, medium)
- JavaScript: Compare with Claude leader (expressjs/express, medium)
- TypeScript: Compare with Gemini leader (microsoft/TypeScript, large)

## Metrics to Collect

For each test, we'll collect the following metrics:

1. Response Time: Time to generate responses (seconds)
2. Response Size: Size of generated content (bytes)
3. Quality Score: Manual evaluation of insights (1-10 scale)
4. Repository Coverage: Assessment of how well the model covers the codebase
5. Architecture Understanding: Accuracy in detecting patterns and architecture
6. Error Rate: Frequency of factual errors or hallucinations

## Testing Methodology

1. **Consistency**: Use the same DeepWiki server instance with identical configuration
2. **Standardized Queries**: Use the same set of analysis questions for each repository
3. **Multiple Runs**: Perform 3 runs per model-repository combination for statistical validity
4. **Fairness**: Run tests for all models in parallel time periods to avoid API load differences
5. **Comprehensive Logging**: Record all metrics, timestamps, and response details

## Testing Script Updates

We'll need to update our existing testing scripts to add DeepSeek support:

1. Add DeepSeek provider to `check-api-keys.js`
2. Update `comprehensive-test.sh` to include DeepSeek models
3. Create `deepseek-test.sh` for targeted DeepSeek testing

## Implementation Steps

1. **Environment Setup (Day 1)**
   - Add DeepSeek API keys to environment configuration
   - Update DeepWiki configuration to support DeepSeek models
   - Modify testing scripts to include DeepSeek

2. **Initial Testing (Days 2-3)**
   - Run baseline tests against priority 1 repositories
   - Analyze initial results and adjust testing approach if needed
   - Resolve any API integration issues

3. **Comprehensive Testing (Days 4-6)**
   - Perform full test matrix across all selected repositories
   - Collect detailed metrics for each model-repository combination
   - Generate initial performance reports

4. **Analysis and Integration (Days 7-8)**
   - Analyze comprehensive test results
   - Determine optimal model configurations for each language and size
   - Update `repository-model-config.ts` with DeepSeek results
   - Create detailed performance comparison report

5. **Configuration Refinement (Days 9-10)**
   - Refine model selection logic based on test results
   - Update `RepositoryModelSelectionService.ts` if needed
   - Create configuration validation tests
   - Document findings and configuration recommendations

## Expected Outcomes

1. Complete testing data for DeepSeek models across various repository types
2. Updated model configuration that includes DeepSeek for optimal scenarios
3. Documentation of DeepSeek strengths and weaknesses
4. Recommendations for DeepSeek integration in our multi-agent architecture
5. Performance comparison dashboard showing model effectiveness by language and repository size

## Success Criteria

1. DeepSeek models successfully tested across all priority repositories
2. Clear understanding of where DeepSeek models outperform or underperform existing models
3. Updated configurations that correctly select the best model for each context
4. Identification of at least 3 language-size combinations where DeepSeek excels
5. All metrics properly collected and analyzed for informed decision-making

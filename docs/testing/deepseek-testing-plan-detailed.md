# DeepSeek Model Testing Plan

## Overview

This document outlines our comprehensive plan for testing DeepSeek Coder models as part of our repository analysis framework. The goal is to evaluate DeepSeek models across a variety of repository languages and sizes to determine their effectiveness compared to our current production models.

## Test Repository Matrix

We will test DeepSeek models against the following repository matrix:

| Language | Small (<5MB) | Medium (5-50MB) | Large (>50MB) |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|---------------|
| **Python** | Flask microservices | pallets/flask | pytorch/pytorch |
| **JavaScript** | expressjs/express-starter | expressjs/express | facebook/react |
| **TypeScript** | microsoft/typescript-starter | NestJS/nest | microsoft/TypeScript |
| **Go** | gin-gonic/examples | gin-gonic/gin | golang/go |
| **Rust** | rustls/rustls-ffi | rustls/rustls | rust-lang/rust |
| **Java** | spring-guides/gs-rest-service | google/guava | spring-projects/spring-boot |
| **C#** | dotnet/samples | dotnet/aspnetcore | dotnet/runtime |
| **C/C++** | protocolbuffers/protocolbuffers-examples | protocolbuffers/protobuf-lite | protocolbuffers/protobuf |
| **PHP** | laravel/laravel | laravel/framework | wordpress/wordpress |
| **Ruby** | rails/rails-examples | sinatra/sinatra | rails/rails |

## DeepSeek Models to Test

We'll test the following DeepSeek models:

1. **DeepSeek Coder** - Base model
2. **DeepSeek Coder Plus** - Enhanced model with better code understanding
3. **DeepSeek Coder Lite** - Lightweight model for faster analyses

## Comparison Models

We'll compare DeepSeek models against our current top performers:

1. **OpenAI GPT-4o** - Current best for small repositories
2. **Anthropic Claude 3.7 Sonnet** - Current best for detailed analysis
3. **Google Gemini 2.5 Pro** - Current best for TypeScript and balanced performance

## Test Categories

We'll test the models across three analysis categories:

1. **Repository Analysis** - Full repository structure and architecture analysis
2. **PR Analysis** - Code review and change analysis
3. **Targeted Deep Dives** - Focused analysis on specific components or patterns

## Test Methodology

### 1. Setup Phase

1. Deploy DeepWiki with DeepSeek models enabled
2. Configure API keys and access
3. Prepare test repositories and PRs
4. Set up metrics collection

### 2. Execution Phase

For each repository in the matrix:

1. Run repository analysis with each model
2. Create test PRs or use existing PRs for PR analysis
3. Conduct targeted deep dive analyses
4. Collect metrics for all runs

### 3. Metrics Collection

For each test run, we'll collect:

1. **Response Time** - Time to generate analysis
2. **Token Usage** - Input and output tokens used
3. **Response Size** - Size of generated content
4. **Accuracy** - Manual evaluation of correctness
5. **Depth** - Assessment of analysis depth
6. **Comprehensiveness** - Coverage of repository aspects
7. **Error Rate** - Frequency of hallucinations or factual errors

### 4. Quality Assessment

For a subset of repositories, we'll conduct manual quality assessments:

1. **Architecture Understanding** - How well the model understands overall architecture
2. **Code Quality Insights** - Quality of code improvement suggestions
3. **Security Awareness** - Detection of security issues
4. **Documentation Quality** - Quality of documentation suggestions
5. **Educational Value** - Usefulness of educational context provided

## Testing Tools

We'll use the following tools for testing:

1. **DeepWiki Test Suite** - Our existing test framework
2. **Test Automation Scripts** - Custom scripts for batch testing
3. **Metrics Collection API** - For gathering performance data
4. **Quality Assessment Dashboard** - For manual evaluations

## Schedule

| Week | Activity |
|------|----------|
| Week 1 | Setup DeepSeek integration and prepare test repositories |
| Week 2 | Test small repositories across all languages |
| Week 3 | Test medium repositories across all languages |
| Week 4 | Test large repositories across all languages |
| Week 5 | Conduct quality assessments and analyze results |

## Testing Scripts

We'll develop the following testing scripts:

1. `deepseek-test.sh` - Main test runner for DeepSeek models
2. `comparison-test.sh` - Runner for comparison tests
3. `collect-metrics.js` - Metrics collection script
4. `generate-report.js` - Results reporting script

## Expected Outcomes

We expect to determine:

1. Which languages DeepSeek models excel at analyzing
2. How DeepSeek models compare to our current models
3. Which repository sizes are optimal for DeepSeek models
4. Whether DeepSeek models should replace current models for certain contexts
5. How to calibrate our model selection system with DeepSeek models

## Implementation Plan

After testing is complete, we'll:

1. Update `repository-model-config.ts` with DeepSeek results
2. Integrate DeepSeek models into our model selection service
3. Implement calibration for optimal model selection
4. Update the deployment configuration for production use

## Resources Required

1. DeepSeek API access and credits
2. Testing server capacity
3. Developer time for script development and analysis
4. Quality assessment team for manual evaluations

## Success Criteria

The testing will be considered successful if:

1. All repositories in the matrix are tested with all models
2. Comparative metrics are collected for all tests
3. Clear patterns emerge for model strengths by language and size
4. We can make data-driven decisions for model selection
5. At least one language is identified where DeepSeek outperforms current models

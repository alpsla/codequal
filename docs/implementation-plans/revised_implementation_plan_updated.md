This architecture allows any agent type to fulfill any functional role, with behavior determined by configuration and context rather than inheritance.

## Three-Tier Analysis Approach

Based on our testing and analysis of DeepWiki capabilities, we've refined our approach to a three-tier analysis model to provide optimal flexibility:

1. **Quick PR-Only Analysis**:
   - Focuses only on PR and changed files
   - Completes in 1-3 minutes
   - Provides immediate feedback for day-to-day development
   - Offers syntax checking, code quality, basic security scanning

2. **Comprehensive Repository + PR Analysis**:
   - Performs deep repository analysis followed by PR analysis
   - Takes 5-10 minutes for complete results
   - Caches repository analysis for future use
   - Provides architectural insights, dependency analysis, pattern consistency checking
   - Best for major features, architectural changes, or periodic reviews

3. **Targeted Architectural Deep Dives**:
   - Focused analysis on specific architectural aspects or concerns
   - Leverages DeepWiki Chat API for targeted inquiries
   - Supplements the standard analysis when needed
   - Presented as architectural perspectives rather than technical queries
   - Allows deeper exploration of specific code areas or patterns

## DeepWiki Integration Strategy

Our testing with DeepWiki has revealed both capabilities and limitations that have informed our integration approach:

### Key Findings from DeepWiki Testing

- Successfully generates comprehensive wiki-style documentation for repositories
- Provides valuable architectural insights and pattern recognition
- Outputs structured knowledge about code organization and dependencies
- Has token limitations for very large repositories (~300,000 tokens maximum)
- Requires API key configuration for model access (OpenAI and Google AI)
- Supports both full repository analysis and targeted questions via chat API
- **Already deployed and operational in our DigitalOcean Kubernetes cluster**

### Integration Approach

1. **Kubernetes-Native Integration** (IMPLEMENTED):
   - Leverage existing DeepWiki deployment in DigitalOcean Kubernetes cluster
   - Access DeepWiki console/CLI directly within Kubernetes pods
   - Implement Kubernetes-aware service to interact with DeepWiki pods
   - Utilize kubectl exec or similar mechanisms for command execution
   - Monitor and log interactions using Kubernetes native tooling
   - Integrate with existing Kubernetes observability stack

2. **Client Service Creation**:
   - Create a `DeepWikiKubernetesService` class for interacting with DeepWiki in K8s
   - Implement methods for repository analysis and targeted queries
   - Handle authentication, retries, and error cases
   - Support both full wiki generation and chat completions

3. **Intelligent Analysis Flow**:
   - Start with cached repository analysis when available
   - Generate initial PR analysis with repository context
   - Identify if deeper architectural analysis would be beneficial
   - Present options to users as architectural perspectives
   - Allow users to select perspectives for deeper analysis

4. **Repository Size Handling**:
   - Implement detection for repositories exceeding token limits
   - Create chunking strategies for large repositories
   - Prioritize critical components when faced with size constraints
   - Provide clear feedback to users about limitations

5. **Result Storage and Caching**:
   - Design database schema for storing analysis results
   - Implement caching with appropriate invalidation strategies
   - Create APIs for efficient retrieval of cached analyses
   - Support incremental updates when repository changes

## Selective RAG Framework

Based on our latest architectural decisions, we're implementing a selective retrieval approach for the RAG framework:

### Key Components

1. **Query Analyzer**: 
   - Analyzes user queries to identify key concepts, components, and intentions
   - Determines what portions of the repository are relevant to the query
   - Identifies appropriate metadata filters to narrow search space
   - Enhances retrieval precision by focusing only on relevant repository areas

2. **Metadata-Filtered Search**:
   - Uses rich metadata to filter vector search (file types, components, etc.)
   - Applies query-specific filters rather than searching entire repository
   - Optimizes retrieval efficiency and reduces noise in results
   - Increases result relevance through targeted searching

3. **Enhanced Ranking System**:
   - Implements sophisticated re-ranking based on query analysis
   - Boosts scores for exact component matches
   - Applies concept-based boosting for query-relevant content
   - Sorts results based on enhanced relevance scoring

4. **Incremental Update Strategy**:
   - Supports efficient delta updates rather than full reindexing
   - Tracks repository changes (commits, PRs, file changes)
   - Processes only changed files instead of entire repository
   - Maintains version information for each repository's index

### Integration with Support System

The RAG framework will provide targeted support by:

1. **Knowledge Source Integration**:
   - Combining general knowledge base content with repository-specific information
   - Retrieving cross-repository patterns for common issues and best practices
   - Selecting knowledge sources based on query type and context
   - Applying appropriate weighting to different knowledge sources

2. **User Skill Adaptation**:
   - Tracking user expertise with SQL database (not vector storage)
   - Adapting response detail level to user skill profile
   - Progressively adjusting content complexity as user skills evolve
   - Providing skill-appropriate explanations and examples

## DeepWiki Chat Integration and POC

Our proof-of-concept (POC) for DeepWiki Chat has provided valuable insights:

### 1. Core Architecture (MCP Pattern)

Our implemented POC follows the Message Control Program (MCP) pattern:
- Centralized control flow for the entire chat process
- Authentication and repository access verification
- Selective context retrieval based on query analysis
- Model selection with fallback capabilities
- Response formatting and delivery

### 2. Tiered Model Approach

The POC demonstrated the viability of a tiered model approach:
- **Primary Model**: DeepSeek Chat (good performance/cost balance)
- **Fallback Models**: Gemini 2.5 Flash, Claude 3 Haiku
- Cost-effective model selection for interactive chat vs. full analysis
- Reliability through fallback mechanism when models are unavailable

### 3. Multi-Repository Support

The POC validated our approach to multi-repository support:
- Repository selection capability for users with multiple repositories
- Permission verification before processing chat requests
- Repository-specific context retrieval
- Cross-repository pattern identification for best practices

### 4. Next Steps for Chat Implementation

Building on the POC, our full implementation will include:
- Integration with Supabase for authentication and user management
- Implementation of selective RAG retrieval with metadata filtering
- Real model integration with OpenRouter
- User skill tracking and response adaptation

## Scoring and Vector Database Integration

We've implemented a comprehensive scoring system to quantify repository quality across multiple dimensions:

### 1. Specialized Analysis Scoring (IMPLEMENTED)
- Each specialized analysis (architecture, code quality, security, dependencies, performance) now includes:
  - Overall category score (1-10 scale)
  - Subcategory scoring with specific metrics
  - Severity-based issue identification (high/medium/low)
  - Scoring justifications and impact assessments

### 2. Repository-Level Scoring
- Combined overall repository score based on weighted category scores
- Visualization-ready metrics for Grafana dashboards
- Trend analysis for score changes over time
- Benchmark comparisons with similar repositories

### 3. Vector Database Integration
- Scoring metadata is structured for vector database storage
- Each analysis chunk includes:
  - Repository metadata (name, language, size)
  - Category and subcategory scores
  - Identified issues with severity ratings
  - File paths referenced in the analysis
  - Storage classification (permanent vs. cached)
  - Enhanced metadata for selective retrieval

### 4. Two-Phase Storage Strategy
- **Phase 1: Base Scoring** (IMPLEMENTED)
  - Generate scores for each specialized analysis
  - Store metadata with each analysis section
  - Consolidate scores for repository-level assessment
  
- **Phase 2: Selective Vector Integration** (IN PROGRESS)
  - Chunk analyses into 300-500 token segments
  - Generate embeddings for each segment
  - Store in Supabase with pgvector for similarity search
  - Implement enhanced metadata for selective retrieval
  - Create optimized filtering functions for targeted queries

This scoring system provides a foundation for quantifiable repository quality assessment, trend visualization, and intelligent PR analysis.

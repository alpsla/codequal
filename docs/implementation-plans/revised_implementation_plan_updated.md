## Revised Architecture

Based on our latest design decisions, we are implementing a flexible, configuration-driven multi-agent architecture with adaptive agent selection. Key components include:

1. **Agent Evaluation System**: Collects and utilizes performance data to select optimal agents for different contexts âœ…
2. **Multi-Agent Factory**: Creates agent configurations based on analysis needs âœ…
3. **Multi-Agent Orchestrator**: Analyzes repository/PR context and determines required roles and optimal agents ðŸ”„
4. **Prompt Generator**: Generates dynamic, context-aware prompts based on agent role and position ðŸ”„
5. **Multi-Agent Executor**: Runs configured agents with fallback capabilities ðŸ”²
6. **Result Orchestrator**: Combines and organizes results from multiple agents ðŸ”²

8. **DeepWiki Integration**: Provides repository analysis capabilities âœ…
9. **RAG Integration**: Enhances education, support, and knowledge base features ðŸ”„ (Design complete, implementation in progress)

This architecture allows any agent type to fulfill any functional role, with behavior determined by configuration and context rather than inheritance.

## Three-Tier Analysis Approach

Based on our testing and analysis of DeepWiki capabilities, we've refined our approach to a three-tier analysis model to provide optimal flexibility:

1. **Quick PR-Only Analysis**:
   - Focuses only on PR and changed files
   - Completes in 1-3 minutes
   - Provides immediate feedback for day-to-day development
   - Offers syntax checking, code quality, basic security scanning

2. **Comprehensive Repository + PR Analysis**:
   - Performs deep repository analysis followed by PR analysis
   - Takes 5-10 minutes for complete results
   - Caches repository analysis for future use
   - Provides architectural insights, dependency analysis, pattern consistency checking
   - Best for major features, architectural changes, or periodic reviews

3. **Targeted Architectural Deep Dives** (NEW):
   - Focused analysis on specific architectural aspects or concerns
   - Leverages DeepWiki Chat API for targeted inquiries
   - Supplements the standard analysis when needed
   - Presented as architectural perspectives rather than technical queries
   - Allows deeper exploration of specific code areas or patterns

## DeepWiki Integration Strategy

Our testing with DeepWiki has revealed both capabilities and limitations that have informed our integration approach:

### Key Findings from DeepWiki Testing

- Successfully generates comprehensive wiki-style documentation for repositories
- Provides valuable architectural insights and pattern recognition
- Outputs structured knowledge about code organization and dependencies
- Has token limitations for very large repositories (~300,000 tokens maximum)
- Requires API key configuration for model access (OpenAI and Google AI)
- Supports both full repository analysis and targeted questions via chat API

### Integration Approach

1. **Client Service Creation**:
   - Create a `DeepWikiClient` class for interacting with DeepWiki
   - Implement methods for repository analysis and targeted queries
   - Handle authentication, retries, and error cases
   - Support both full wiki generation and chat completions

2. **Intelligent Analysis Flow**:
   - Start with cached repository analysis when available
   - Generate initial PR analysis with repository context
   - Identify if deeper architectural analysis would be beneficial
   - Present options to users as architectural perspectives
   - Allow users to select perspectives for deeper analysis

3. **Repository Size Handling**:
   - Implement detection for repositories exceeding token limits
   - Create chunking strategies for large repositories
   - Prioritize critical components when faced with size constraints
   - Provide clear feedback to users about limitations

4. **Result Storage and Caching**:
   - Design database schema for storing analysis results
   - Implement caching with appropriate invalidation strategies
   - Create APIs for efficient retrieval of cached analyses
   - Support incremental updates when repository changes

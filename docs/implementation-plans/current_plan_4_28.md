Guiding Development Principles
Type Safety: Ensure all code is properly typed with TypeScript
Modular Design: Keep components loosely coupled for easier testing and maintenance
Test Coverage: Write tests for all critical functionality
Documentation: Document all key components and interfaces
Performance: Optimize for low latency and efficient token usage
Development Workflow
Create issue/task in project board
Create branch for implementation
Write tests for new functionality
Implement feature
Submit PR for review
Merge once approved
Resource Allocation
Frontend Development: Focus on user experience and visualization
Backend Development: Core agent architecture and API implementation
Database Design: Schema evolution and data access
DevOps: CI/CD pipeline and deployment
Success Metrics
All code compiles without TypeScript errors
Tests pass with >80% coverage
PR analysis works with multiple agent providers
Results are stored and retrievable from database
Basic UI for viewing analysis results

# CodeQual Implementation Plan
**Last Updated: April 28, 2025**

## Current Status (April 2025)
We have created the initial project structure based on the proposed architecture for the CodeQual PR review tool. The current state includes:

- Basic directory structure created for all packages

  - Create Supabase project
  - Execute database schema
  - Create seed data for skill categories
  - Implement initial database access services
- **Prompt Engineering**
  - Refine component-based prompt system
  - Create model-specific optimizations
  - Implement prompt testing/validation

### 3. Develop Basic Features (Weeks 4-5)
- **PR Review Service**

  - Add basic user roles

### 4. Add Testing Framework (Weeks 6-7)
- **Agent Testing**
  - Implement test runner
  - Create cost tracking
  - Add metrics calculation
  - Build reporting system
  
### 5. Unified Agent Reporting Format (Weeks 4-5)
- **Design Minimal Unified Format**
  - Define core schema for insights (issues with severity)
  - Create structure for suggestions (recommended fixes)
  - Design format for educational content
  - Establish metadata requirements (execution info, timestamps)
- **Build Simple Adapters**
  - Implement basic adapters for each agent type
  - Focus on mapping essential fields
  - Create transformation utilities for common data patterns
  - Add validation for format compliance
- **Create Format Documentation**
  - Document schema specification
  - Provide examples of valid responses
  - Create adapter implementation guide
  - Document extension points for future enhancements

### 6. Reporting UI Development (Weeks 5-12)
- **Phase 1: Core Components (Weeks 5-7)**
  - Implement basic report display with read-only views
  - Create issue navigation and filtering system
  - Build code diff visualization component
  - Design basic UI layout and navigation
- **Phase 2: Interactive Features (Weeks 8-9)**
  - Add suggestion acceptance/rejection functionality
  - Implement filter persistence and customization
  - Create educational content display
  - Build export functionality (PDF/Markdown)
- **Phase 3: Integration & Analytics (Weeks 10-12)**
  - Implement GitHub/GitLab comment generation
  - Add issue tracking system integration
  - Build trend visualization components
  - Create skill development tracking display

## Guiding Development Principles
- **Type Safety**: Ensure all code is properly typed with TypeScript
- **Modular Design**: Keep components loosely coupled for easier testing and maintenance
- **Test Coverage**: Write tests for all critical functionality
- **Documentation**: Document all key components and interfaces
- **Performance**: Optimize for low latency and efficient token usage
- **Usability**: Create intuitive, responsive interfaces with clear information hierarchy

## Development Workflow
1. Create issue/task in project board
2. Create branch for implementation
3. Write tests for new functionality
4. Implement feature
5. Submit PR for review
6. Merge once approved

## Resource Allocation
- **Frontend Development**: UI/UX design, component development, visualization
- **Backend Development**: Core agent architecture and API implementation
- **Prompt Engineering**: Optimize prompts for different model providers
- **Database Design**: Schema evolution and data access
- **DevOps**: CI/CD pipeline and deployment

## Success Metrics
- All code compiles without TypeScript errors
- Tests pass with >80% coverage
- PR analysis works with multiple agent providers
- Results are stored and retrievable from database
- UI provides clear, actionable insights from analyses
- Reports can be exported in multiple formats
- Performance metrics meet targets (response time, token efficiency)
- User satisfaction with recommendations and educational content

## Task Status Legend

- üî¥ **High Priority**: Must be done for system to function
- üü° **Medium Priority**: Important but not blocking
- üü¢ **Low Priority**: Nice to have, can be deferred
- ‚úÖ **Completed**: Done and verified
- üöß **In Progress**: Currently being worked on
- ‚è∏Ô∏è **Blocked**: Waiting on dependencies

## Success Metrics

### Short Term (2 weeks)
- All core agents migrated to /standard
- All interfaces defined and documented
- Basic monitoring in place
- Build passing with no errors

### Medium Term (4 weeks)
- API fully migrated
- 80% test coverage
- All integrations working
- Performance benchmarks established

### Long Term (16 weeks)
- Production deployment live
- 99.9% uptime
- <200ms average response time
- Supporting 1000+ concurrent users

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **DeepWiki API changes**: Wrapped in service interface
2. **Database performance**: Caching layer planned
3. **Scaling issues**: Kubernetes auto-scaling
4. **Security vulnerabilities**: Regular audits

### Business Risks
1. **Competitor features**: Rapid iteration capability
2. **User adoption**: Focus on developer experience
3. **Pricing model**: Flexible billing integration
4. **Support burden**: Comprehensive documentation

## Dependencies

### External Services
- Supabase (database, auth)
- DeepWiki Cloud (AI analysis)
- Stripe (billing)
- Redis (caching)
- GitHub/GitLab (integrations)

### Internal Systems
- Orchestrator (coordinator)
- Comparison Agent (analysis)
- Researcher Agent (model selection)
- Educator Agent (learning resources)

## Notes

- This plan is updated weekly
- Task IDs match the TodoWrite tool
- Completed items are moved to archive section
- New tasks are added as discovered

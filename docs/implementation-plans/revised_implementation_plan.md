# CodeQual Revised Implementation Plan
**Last Updated: May 4, 2025**

## Current Status (May 2025)

We have significantly improved the project foundation and made progress with agent integrations. The current state includes:

- âœ… Fixed TypeScript configuration and dependency issues
- âœ… Created proper build scripts for package sequencing
- âœ… Implemented type-safe Supabase integration
- âœ… Developed database models for core entities
- âœ… Established agent architecture with direct model integration
- âœ… Configured CI pipeline with proper error handling
- âœ… Resolved module resolution issues in TypeScript monorepo

- âœ… Created initial multi-agent strategy framework
- âœ… Designed unified agent reporting format
- âœ… Implemented Multi-Agent Factory with fallback functionality
- âœ… Completed Agent Evaluation System with comprehensive testing

## Revised Architecture

Based on our latest design decisions, we are implementing a flexible, configuration-driven multi-agent architecture with adaptive agent selection. Key components include:

1. **Agent Evaluation System**: Collects and utilizes performance data to select optimal agents for different contexts âœ…
2. **Multi-Agent Factory**: Creates agent configurations based on analysis needs
3. **Multi-Agent Orchestrator**: Analyzes repository/PR context and determines required roles and optimal agents
4. **Prompt Generator**: Generates dynamic, context-aware prompts based on agent role and position
5. **Multi-Agent Executor**: Runs configured agents with fallback capabilities
6. **Result Orchestrator**: Combines and organizes results from multiple agents
7. **Reporting Agent**: Formats results into polished final reports

This architecture allows any agent type to fulfill any functional role, with behavior determined by configuration and context rather than inheritance.

## Two-Tier Analysis Approach

We are implementing a dual analysis mode to balance speed and depth:

1. **Quick PR-Only Analysis**:
   - Focuses only on PR and changed files
   - Completes in 1-3 minutes
   - Provides immediate feedback for day-to-day development
   - Offers syntax checking, code quality, basic security scanning

2. **Comprehensive Repository + PR Analysis**:
   - Performs deep repository analysis followed by PR analysis
   - Takes 5-10 minutes for complete results
   - Caches repository analysis for future use
   - Provides architectural insights, dependency analysis, pattern consistency checking
   - Best for major features, architectural changes, or periodic reviews

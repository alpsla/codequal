# CodeQual Complete Roadmap - CORRECTED
**Last Updated: May 30, 2025**

This document contains the complete roadmap for CodeQual, including current status, immediate next steps, and all planned future features.

**CORRECTION**: This roadmap now accurately reflects the missing critical components identified from the archived implementation plan.

---

## 🎯 **Current Status Overview**

**Project Completion: ~60% (CORRECTED)**
- ✅ **Core Infrastructure**: 100% complete
- ✅ **Agent Architecture**: 100% complete  
- ✅ **RAG Framework**: 95% complete
- ✅ **Database Schema**: 100% complete
- ✅ **DeepWiki Integration**: 100% complete
- 🔄 **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: 70% complete
- 🔲 **Multi-Agent Executor**: 0% complete (CRITICAL MISSING)
- 🔲 **Result Orchestrator**: 0% complete (CRITICAL MISSING)
- 🔲 **CI/CD Workflow Integration**: 0% complete (CRITICAL MISSING)
- 🔲 **DeepWiki Chat Implementation**: 20% complete (MISSING)
- 🔲 **Support System Integration**: 0% complete (MISSING)
- 🔲 **Prompt Generator**: 0% complete (MISSING)
- 🔲 **Reporting Agent**: 0% complete (MISSING)
- 🔲 **User Interface**: Not started
- 🔲 **Advanced Analytics**: Not started

---

## 💡 **WHY CI/CD INTEGRATION IS CRITICAL**

**User Workflow Integration**: Users need CodeQual to integrate seamlessly into their existing development workflow, not as a separate tool they have to remember to use.

**Key Benefits:**
- **Automated Analysis**: Triggers analysis on every PR without manual intervention
- **Quality Gates**: Prevents merging PRs that don't meet quality standards
- **Developer Adoption**: Developers see value immediately in their existing workflow
- **Enterprise Value**: Essential for enterprise adoption and compliance
- **Competitive Advantage**: Most code analysis tools focus on standalone analysis

**Without CI/CD Integration:**
- Users must manually trigger analysis (low adoption)
- No automatic quality enforcement
- Limited enterprise appeal
- Reduced business value

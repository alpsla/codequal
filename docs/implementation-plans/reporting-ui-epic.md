# Reporting UI Epic

## Overview
The CodeQual PR review tool requires a robust, interactive UI for displaying analysis results. While our agents generate the report content, we need well-designed UI components to present this information effectively to users. This epic outlines the features, components, and development phases for implementing the reporting UI.

## User Stories

### Core Functionality
1. As a developer, I want to see a summary of PR analysis results, so I can quickly understand the key issues.
2. As a reviewer, I want to filter issues by severity, type, and file, so I can focus on specific aspects.
3. As a team lead, I want to view educational content related to findings, so I can help my team improve.
4. As a developer, I want to see code suggestions with diff views, so I can understand proposed changes.
5. As a reviewer, I want to accept/reject suggestions, so I can implement fixes quickly.

### Integration Features
1. As a user, I want to export reports as PDF/Markdown, so I can share with team members.
2. As a developer, I want to generate GitHub/GitLab comments from findings, so I can add them to PRs.
3. As a team lead, I want to integrate with issue tracking systems, so I can create tickets for follow-up.

### Analytics Features
1. As a team lead, I want to see trends in PR quality over time, so I can track team improvement.
2. As a developer, I want to see my skill development based on PR feedback, so I can focus on weak areas.

## UI Components

### Report Overview Dashboard
- Summary metrics (issues by severity, files affected, etc.)
- PR metadata display
- Overall quality score visualization
- Time/cost metrics for analysis

### Issue Browser
- Filterable and sortable issue list
- Severity indicators (high/medium/low)
- Category organization (quality, security, performance)
- Code context display for each issue
- File navigation system

### Code Suggestion Interface
- Side-by-side diff view
- Accept/reject buttons for each suggestion
- Batch application option for similar issues
- Preview mode for applied suggestions

### Educational Content Panel
- Topic-organized learning materials
- Expandable explanations
- Links to external resources
- Skill level indicators for content

### Analytics Dashboard
- Trend charts for code quality metrics
- Team and individual performance tracking
- Skill development visualization
- PR complexity assessment

## Technical Implementation

### Phase 1: Core Components (Weeks 5-7)
- Implement basic report display with read-only views
- Create issue navigation and filtering system
- Build code diff visualization component
- Design basic UI layout and navigation

### Phase 2: Interactive Features (Weeks 8-9)
- Add suggestion acceptance/rejection functionality
- Implement filter persistence and customization
- Create educational content display
- Build export functionality (PDF/Markdown)

### Phase 3: Integration & Analytics (Weeks 10-12)
- Implement GitHub/GitLab comment generation
- Add issue tracking system integration
- Build trend visualization components
- Create skill development tracking display

## Technical Requirements

### UI Framework
- React with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Recharts for data visualization
- Monaco Editor for code display

### State Management
- React Context API for local state
- Fetch API for data retrieval
- LocalStorage for user preferences

### Integration Points
- GitHub/GitLab APIs
- Issue tracking system APIs (Jira, Linear, etc.)
- Analytics data from CodeQual database

## Success Metrics
- Report renders correctly for all agent result formats
- UI remains responsive with large PR datasets
- All interactive features work as expected
- Integration with external systems functions properly
- Load time under 2 seconds for typical reports

## Dependencies
- Agent architecture must produce standardized output format
- Database schema must support analytics data storage
- Authentication system must be in place for user-specific features

## Risks and Mitigations
- **Risk**: Inconsistent agent output formats
  - **Mitigation**: Develop adapter layer to normalize different formats

- **Risk**: Performance issues with large PRs
  - **Mitigation**: Implement virtualized rendering and pagination

- **Risk**: Integration challenges with external systems
  - **Mitigation**: Create mock interfaces for development and testing

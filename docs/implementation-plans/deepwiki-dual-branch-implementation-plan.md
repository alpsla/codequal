# DeepWiki Dual-Branch Implementation Plan
*Created: July 28, 2025*

## Executive Summary
After comprehensive testing revealed that 9 out of 10 MCP tools provide no value for PR analysis, we're pivoting to a DeepWiki-centric architecture using dual-branch analysis. This approach will reduce code complexity by 85% while providing more accurate and meaningful PR insights.

## Current State Assessment

### Tools Providing No Value (To Be Removed)
1. **dependency-cruiser-mcp** - 0 findings on test PRs
2. **eslint-mcp** - 0 findings, redundant with IDE integration
3. **jscpd-mcp** - 0 findings, ineffective for PR analysis
4. **lighthouse-mcp** - Not applicable to PR code changes
5. **semgrep-mcp** - 0 findings, requires complex rule configuration
6. **serena-mcp** - 0 findings, language server issues
7. **sonarjs-mcp** - 0 findings, overlaps with ESLint
8. **ref-mcp** - Generic web search, no PR-specific insights
9. **context-retrieval-mcp** - Returns hardcoded mock data

### Components to Keep
- Git operations (clone, branch, diff)
- Vector DB storage with fallback
- Basic PR context extraction
- DeepWiki integration (enhanced)

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Pre-Implementation (Days 1-2)
**Status: In Progress**

- [x] Complete tool output analysis
- [x] Document findings and recommendations
- [x] Create POC for dual-branch concept
- [ ] Commit current state before major changes
- [ ] Create rollback strategy

### Phase 2: DeepWiki Enhancement (Days 3-5)
**Goal: Build enhanced DeepWiki service with dual-branch capabilities**

#### Tasks:
1. **Investigate DeepWiki API**
   - [ ] Document all available endpoints
   - [ ] Test chat API capabilities
   - [ ] Understand rate limits and quotas
   - [ ] Explore batch analysis options

2. **Implement Enhanced Service**
   ```typescript
   class EnhancedDeepWikiService {
     // Core analysis methods
     analyzeBaseline(repoPath: string): Promise<DeepWikiResults>
     analyzeFeature(repoPath: string): Promise<DeepWikiResults>
     compareResults(base: Results, feature: Results): ChangeAnalysis
     
     // Chat integration
     askQuestion(context: ChangeAnalysis, question: string): Promise<Answer>
     generateSummary(changes: ChangeAnalysis): Promise<Summary>
   }
   ```

3. **Build Comparison Engine**
   - [ ] Identify changed files between branches
   - [ ] Compare DeepWiki findings
   - [ ] Detect new issues vs existing issues
   - [ ] Calculate impact scores

### Phase 3: Simplified Orchestration (Days 6-7)
**Goal: Replace complex multi-tool orchestration with streamlined flow**

#### Tasks:
1. **Remove Tool Selection Logic**
   - [ ] Delete tool registry mappings
   - [ ] Remove role-based selection
   - [ ] Eliminate parallel execution complexity

2. **Implement Direct Flow**
   ```typescript
   async analyzePR(request: PRRequest): Promise<Analysis> {
     // 1. Extract PR context
     const context = await this.extractContext(request);
     
     // 2. Run DeepWiki dual-branch analysis
     const analysis = await this.deepwiki.analyzePullRequest(context);
     
     // 3. Store in vector DB
     await this.vectorDB.store(analysis);
     
     // 4. Generate report
     return this.reporter.generate(analysis);
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Incremental Cleanup (Days 8-10)
**Goal: Remove unused components while maintaining stability**

#### Removal Order:
1. **Day 8: Remove Mock Tools**
   - [ ] context-retrieval-mcp
   - [ ] Test system still builds

2. **Day 9: Remove Zero-Value Tools**
   - [ ] dependency-cruiser-mcp
   - [ ] eslint-mcp
   - [ ] jscpd-mcp
   - [ ] sonarjs-mcp
   - [ ] Verify no breaking dependencies

3. **Day 10: Remove Complex Tools**
   - [ ] lighthouse-mcp
   - [ ] semgrep-mcp
   - [ ] serena-mcp
   - [ ] ref-mcp
   - [ ] Clean up related configs

### Phase 5: Integration Testing (Days 11-12)
**Goal: Validate new architecture with real-world data**

#### Test Scenarios:
1. **Small PR** (< 10 files)
   - [ ] Test analysis speed
   - [ ] Verify change detection
   - [ ] Check report quality

2. **Large PR** (> 100 files)
   - [ ] Test performance
   - [ ] Verify memory usage
   - [ ] Check timeout handling

3. **Complex PR** (multiple languages/frameworks)
   - [ ] Test language detection
   - [ ] Verify comprehensive analysis
   - [ ] Check edge cases

### Phase 6: Performance Optimization (Days 13-14)
**Goal: Optimize for production workloads**

#### Optimizations:
1. **Caching Strategy**
   - [ ] Cache baseline analyses
   - [ ] Implement smart invalidation
   - [ ] Add TTL management

2. **Resource Management**
   - [ ] Optimize git operations
   - [ ] Implement cleanup routines
   - [ ] Add memory limits

3. **Parallel Processing**
   - [ ] Parallelize where beneficial
   - [ ] Implement queue management
   - [ ] Add retry logic

## Success Metrics

### Code Quality
- [ ] 85% reduction in codebase size
- [ ] Simplified architecture documentation
- [ ] Reduced cyclomatic complexity

### Performance
- [ ] < 30s analysis for small PRs
- [ ] < 2min analysis for large PRs
- [ ] < 500MB memory usage

### Accuracy
- [ ] 100% of changes detected
- [ ] Meaningful insights for each PR
- [ ] Reduced false positives

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **DeepWiki API Limitations**
   - Mitigation: Build fallback mechanisms
   - Contingency: Keep minimal tool set

2. **Performance Degradation**
   - Mitigation: Implement caching
   - Contingency: Add worker pools

3. **Breaking Changes**
   - Mitigation: Incremental removal
   - Contingency: Git rollback points

### Business Risks
1. **Feature Parity**
   - Ensure all valuable features preserved
   - Document any removed capabilities

2. **User Experience**
   - Maintain or improve analysis quality
   - Ensure smooth transition

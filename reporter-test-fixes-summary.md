# Reporter Agent Test Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Jest Globals Import Issue
**Problem**: Tests were importing from `@jest/globals` which was causing syntax errors.
```typescript
import { describe, it, expect, jest, beforeEach } from '@jest/globals';
```

**Solution**: Replaced with global Jest functions
```typescript
// eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars
const { describe, it, expect, jest, beforeEach } = globalThis;
```

**Files Fixed**:
- `/packages/agents/src/multi-agent/__tests__/reporter-agent-standard.test.ts`
- `/packages/agents/src/multi-agent/__tests__/reporter-agent-integration.test.ts`
- `/packages/testing/src/integration/educational-agent/educational-reporter-integration.test.ts`
- `/packages/testing/src/integration/end-to-end-report-flow.test.ts`

### 2. Import Path Issues in Integration Tests
**Problem**: Tests in the testing package had incorrect relative import paths
```typescript
import { ResultOrchestrator } from '../../apps/api/src/services/result-orchestrator';
```

**Solution**: Fixed the relative paths
```typescript
import { ResultOrchestrator } from '../../../../apps/api/src/services/result-orchestrator';
```

**Files Fixed**:
- `/packages/testing/src/integration/end-to-end-report-flow.test.ts` (all mock paths and require statements)

## Test Structure

### Unit Tests (in packages/agents)
1. **reporter-agent-standard.test.ts**
   - Tests the StandardReport generation
   - Tests report formatting for different output types
   - Tests Vector DB enrichment

2. **reporter-agent-integration.test.ts**
   - Tests complete StandardReport generation with all modules
   - Tests export format variations (email, Slack, PR comment)
   - Tests handling of missing data

### Integration Tests (in packages/testing)
1. **educational-reporter-integration.test.ts**
   - Tests search prompt generation
   - Tests educational content depth variations
   - Tests Vector DB integration
   - Tests format-specific adaptations

2. **end-to-end-report-flow.test.ts**
   - Tests complete PR analysis to report storage flow
   - Tests Supabase integration
   - Tests report retrieval API

## Running the Tests

### Option 1: Run all tests from root
```bash
npm test
```

### Option 2: Run specific package tests
```bash
# From agents package
cd packages/agents
npm test -- src/multi-agent/__tests__/reporter-agent-standard.test.ts
npm test -- src/multi-agent/__tests__/reporter-agent-integration.test.ts

# From testing package
cd packages/testing
npm test -- src/integration/educational-agent/educational-reporter-integration.test.ts
npm test -- src/integration/end-to-end-report-flow.test.ts
```

### Option 3: Use test runner scripts
```bash
# Run all reporter tests
bash run-reporter-tests-direct.sh

# Build and test
bash test-reporter-build.sh
```

## Expected Results

All tests should now pass without import errors. The tests validate:
1. ✅ StandardReport generation for UI consumption
2. ✅ Educational content integration
3. ✅ Multiple export formats (PR comment, email, Slack, etc.)
4. ✅ Vector DB enrichment functionality
5. ✅ End-to-end flow from analysis to Supabase storage

## Next Steps

1. Run the tests to confirm they pass
2. If any tests fail due to missing dependencies or mocks, update the mock implementations
3. Verify the Reporter Agent generates the expected StandardReport structure
4. Test the integration with the UI components once they're implemented

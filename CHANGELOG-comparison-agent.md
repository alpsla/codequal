  - Team trend analysis
  
- **Database Schema** - New tables for analytics
  - `repository_scores` - Historical score tracking
  - `issue_tracking` - Issue lifecycle management
  - `user_skills` - Current skill levels
  - `user_skill_history` - Skill progression
  - `team_skill_trends` - Team analytics
  - `team_skill_snapshots` - Point-in-time data
  
- **Testing Suite** - Comprehensive test coverage
  - Unit tests for scoring logic
  - Integration tests with mocks

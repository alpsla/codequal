  ‚ùå CRITICAL PROBLEM: Real DeepWiki Integration is Broken

  1. DeepWiki Returns Malformed Data

  - Issue: DeepWiki API returns empty/undefined fields
  - Impact: All issues show "unknown" location, no titles, no severity
  - Evidence: 100% of issues have undefined fields in real API calls

  2. Location Enhancement Completely Fails

  - Issue: "Clarified 0 locations out of 14 unknown issues"
  - Impact: Every issue shows generic locations like package.json:1
  - Root Cause: DeepWiki doesn't provide real file paths or line numbers

  3. Educational Content Crashes

  - Issue: educationalContent.resources.find is not a function
  - Impact: Report generation crashes when educational section is included
  - File: report-generator-v7-html-enhanced.ts:1354

  4. V7 Generator Still Being Used

  - Issue: System defaults to deprecated V7 generator
  - Impact: Using broken code instead of fixed V8 generator
  - Evidence: Error stack shows V7 files, not V8

  5. Repository Cloning Fails

  - Issue: "fatal: could not read Username for 'https://github.com'"
  - Impact: Some repos cannot be analyzed at all
  - Root Cause: DeepWiki authentication misconfigured

  üìã Summary of Issue Categories

  | Category              | Count | Status   |
  |-----------------------|-------|----------|
  | V8 Generator Logic    | 0     | ‚úÖ Fixed  |
  | DeepWiki API Response | 5     | ‚ùå Broken |
  | Location Enhancement  | 3     | ‚ùå Broken |
  | Educational Content   | 1     | ‚ùå Broken |
  | Repository Access     | 1     | ‚ùå Broken |

  üéØ Recommended Actions

  1. IMMEDIATE: Always use USE_DEEPWIKI_MOCK=true until DeepWiki is fixed
  2. HIGH PRIORITY: Fix DeepWiki API to return properly structured data
  3. MEDIUM: Fix educational content resources structure
  4. MEDIUM: Force V8 generator usage by default
  5. LOW: Fix repository cloning authentication

  ‚úÖ What's Working

  - V8 generator with mock data (100% functional)
  - Report HTML/Markdown generation
  - PR metadata display
  - Score calculations (when data is provided)
  - All UI elements and sections

  ‚ùå What's NOT Working

  - Real DeepWiki API integration
  - Location extraction from code
  - Educational resource links
  - Repository cloning for some repos
  - Automatic V8 generator selection

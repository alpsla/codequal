Immediate Assessment
Your Current Assets:

✅ Cloud infrastructure (operational)
✅ Multi-agent framework (5 specialized agents)
✅ MCP tools support (ready to integrate)
✅ Authentication & monitoring (production-ready)
❌ Code analysis engine (DeepWiki broken)

You're essentially one component away from a complete solution.
Strategic Options Revisited
Option A: Emergency Pivot (1-2 weeks)
Quick MCP Integration

Use MCP tools like Semgrep, ESLint, or similar for immediate analysis
Your agents already exist - just need to connect them to real analysis tools
Could be operational within days, not weeks

Option B: Build Custom Analysis (3-4 weeks)
Leverage Your Multi-Agent Architecture
Current Agent Setup → MCP Tools Integration
├── Security Agent → Semgrep MCP
├── Performance Agent → Lighthouse/Custom AST
├── Code Quality Agent → ESLint + Complexity Analysis
├── Dependencies Agent → NPM Audit + License Checker
└── Architecture Agent → Dependency Graph Analysis
Option C: Hybrid Intelligence (2-3 weeks)
Combine Static Analysis + LLM Intelligence

Use MCP tools for factual analysis (vulnerabilities, performance metrics)
Use LLMs for contextual understanding (architecture decisions, code patterns)
Your agents orchestrate both layers

My Recommendation: Option C (Hybrid)
Why?

Fastest path to differentiation - Combining MCP tools with LLM insights gives you capabilities competitors don't have
Leverages your existing investment - All your agents and infrastructure remain valuable
Incremental improvement path - Start with basic MCP integration, add intelligence layer progressively

Implementation Priority:

Week 1: Connect your Security & Code Quality agents to Semgrep/ESLint MCP
Week 2: Add Performance & Dependencies analysis via MCP tools
Week 3: Layer in LLM-based architectural insights and PR context understanding

Critical Question: Do you already have MCP tools selected, or should we identify the best ones for each agent? Also, what's your target for "good enough" to start charging customers - 80% accuracy? 90%?

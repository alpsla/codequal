# DeepWiki Master Cleanup Archive

This archive contains files related to the DeepWiki integration that were archived during the master cleanup on Mon May 19 16:48:34 EDT 2025.

## What's Been Done

1. **Scripts Organization**:
   - Consolidated all DeepWiki scripts in `/scripts/deepwiki/`
   - Archived investigation directories after moving useful scripts
   - Created `deepwiki_analyze_repository.sh` at the root level

2. **Documentation Consolidation**:
   - Created a `/docs/DeepWiki/final/` directory for key documentation
   - Updated the index.md file to point to consolidated documentation
   - Archived unnecessary documentation subdirectories

3. **Root-Level Cleanup**:
   - Archived DeepWiki-related scripts from the root directory
   - Archived previous cleanup scripts

## What's Been Kept

The following structure is now in place:

- `/scripts/deepwiki/`: All DeepWiki integration scripts
- `/docs/DeepWiki/final/`: Consolidated documentation
- `/deepwiki_analyze_repository.sh`: Main analysis script at root level

## Why These Files Were Archived

This directory contains exploratory scripts, early implementations, and multiple iterations of documentation that were creating confusion. Only the final, functional versions have been kept to simplify maintenance and future development.

**Migration Date:** $(date)
**Migration Script:** migrate-existing-data.sh

## Migration Results

### Users Migrated
- **Total users migrated:** $MIGRATED_USERS
- **Users without organizations:** $USERS_WITHOUT_ORGS

### Organizations Created
- **Total organizations:** $ORG_COUNT
- **Default tier:** Free (3 repos, 100 req/hr, 1GB storage)

### Data Integrity
- **Backup created:** $BACKUP_FILE
- **Schema verified:** ‚úÖ All required tables present
- **Relationships verified:** ‚úÖ User-organization links created

## Post-Migration Tasks

1. **Update Application Code:**
   - Replace legacy authentication calls
   - Use new \`SupabaseAuthenticationService\`
   - Update user permission checks

2. **Test Authentication Flow:**
   - Verify existing users can log in
   - Test repository access permissions
   - Validate organization memberships

3. **Configure Monitoring:**
   - Set up Grafana dashboards
   - Configure security alerts
   - Monitor authentication metrics

## Rollback Information

- **Backup file:** $BACKUP_FILE
- **Original auth.users table:** Preserved (not modified)
- **Migration timestamp:** $(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)

## Next Steps

1. Run integration tests: \`./scripts/run-security-tests.sh\`
2. Update application to use new authentication
3. Monitor authentication metrics
4. Consider upgrading user subscription tiers

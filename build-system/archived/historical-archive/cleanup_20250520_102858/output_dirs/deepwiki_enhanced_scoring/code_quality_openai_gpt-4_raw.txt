1. Code style and consistency: 9/10
2. Error handling: 8/10
3. Documentation: 10/10
4. Testing approach: 9/10

Key strengths:
- Consistent use of 'strict mode' across JavaScript files
- Consistent indentation and use of semicolons
- Comprehensive and detailed README documentation
- Extensive use of tests, including edge cases

Areas for improvement:
- Some functions could benefit from more explicit error handling
- Some code blocks lack comments explaining their functionality
- Tests could be further broken down for better isolation of cases
- More extensive use of ES6+ features could enhance readability and efficiency

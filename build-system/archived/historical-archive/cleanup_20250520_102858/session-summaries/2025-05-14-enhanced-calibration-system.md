# May 14, 2025 - Enhanced Calibration System Implementation

## Session Overview

Today we implemented a comprehensive enhancement to the model calibration system to address issues with the initial calibration results that showed suspicious domination by Gemini 1.5 Flash models. We've created a more balanced scoring approach with manual analysis capabilities.

## Key Improvements

1. **Model Selection Updates**:
   - Removed Gemini 1.5 models completely
   - Added Gemini 2.5 models (Pro, Pro Preview, and Flash)
   - Updated model IDs to match current Google AI API standards

2. **Scoring System Rebalancing**:
   - Adjusted the weighting formula for model evaluation:
     - Quality: 50% (previously 70%)
     - Speed: 15% (reduced from 30%)
     - Price: 35% (new factor, comparable to quality)
   - Improved the price score calculation with logarithmic scaling for better differentiation

3. **API Key Management**:
   - Added support for manual API key overrides when automatic authentication fails
   - Implemented interactive key collection during calibration
   - Added detailed error logging for API issues

4. **CSV Reporting**:
   - Created a comprehensive CSV report generator
   - Implemented detailed tabular reporting with all metrics for every model/repository combination
   - Enhanced the system to allow manual verification of calibration results

5. **Code Quality Improvements**:
   - Fixed ESLint issues throughout the codebase
   - Added proper JSDoc documentation to functions
   - Implemented comprehensive error handling
   - Created a centralized results saving utility

## New Files Created

1. **`enhanced-calibration.js`**:
   - Main calibration script with improved scoring system
   - Includes manual API key override capabilities
   - Uses more balanced weighting between quality and price

2. **`generate-detailed-report.js`**:
   - CSV report generator for detailed analysis
   - Creates tabular data for all models and metrics
   - Supports manual verification of calibration logic

3. **`enhanced-model-calibration.md`**:
   - Detailed documentation of the new system
   - Usage instructions for all features
   - Explanation of the scoring system and model selections

## Model Configuration Updates

1. **`model-versions.ts`**:
   - Updated to remove Gemini 1.5 models
   - Added Gemini 2.5 models with correct IDs
   - Updated default and premium model selections

## Next Steps

1. **Run Full Calibration**:
   - Test all models with the new weighted scoring system
   - Generate comprehensive CSV report for analysis
   - Verify that the scoring logic makes sense with real-world results

2. **Analyze Results**:
   - Review the CSV report to evaluate model performance
   - Compare price vs. quality tradeoffs
   - Ensure the scoring system properly balances all factors

3. **Apply Configuration**:
   - Copy the generated configuration to the core package
   - Rebuild the core package with the new model selections
   - Test the system with real repositories

The enhanced calibration system now provides a more balanced approach to model selection, giving appropriate weight to price factors while maintaining quality as a priority. The manual analysis capability through CSV reports will allow for verification of the system's logic and identification of any needed adjustments to the weighting formula.

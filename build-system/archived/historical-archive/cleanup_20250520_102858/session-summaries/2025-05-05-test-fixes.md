# CodeQual Test Fixes - May 5, 2025

## Issues Fixed

We identified and fixed several TypeScript errors in the codebase related to the agent evaluation system implementation:

1. **AgentRole Enum Mismatch**:
   - Updated code to use the correct AgentRole enum values from the core library
   - Changed DOCUMENTATION role to REPORT_GENERATION
   - Added missing roles: ORCHESTRATOR, DEPENDENCY, and REPORT_GENERATION

2. **Record Type Completeness**:
   - Completed the defaultTemperatures record with all required AgentRole values
   - Fixed rolePerformance records in mockAgentEvaluationData to include all roles
   - Added missing role performance data in language-support.test.ts

3. **Type Compatibility**:
   - Changed Record<AgentProvider, number> to Partial<Record<AgentProvider, number>> in baseCosts
   - Added missing MCP providers to the baseCosts record

4. **MultiAgentConfig Type Updates**:
   - Changed direct useMCP property to a globalParameters record
   - Removed references to nonexistent maxConcurrentAgents property in options

5. **Test Updates**:
   - Fixed tests referring to DOCUMENTATION role
   - Updated temperature optimization tests to use REPORT_GENERATION role
   - Fixed specialized-agents.test.ts to use the correct roles
   - Added missing role data in language-support.test.ts

## Implementation Updates

1. **agent-evaluation-data.ts**:
   - Updated defaultTemperatures to include all roles
   - Fixed rolePerformance typings in mockAgentEvaluationData
   - Changed all DOCUMENTATION references to REPORT_GENERATION

2. **agent-selector.ts**:
   - Changed baseCosts to use Partial record type
   - Added MCP providers to baseCosts
   - Fixed getRoleDisplayName to handle REPORT_GENERATION

3. **factory.ts**:
   - Used globalParameters instead of direct useMCP property
   - Added additional metadata to globalParameters (expectedCost, confidence)
   - Fixed maxConcurrentAgents reference

4. **Test Files**:
   - Fixed temperature-optimization.test.ts to use REPORT_GENERATION
   - Updated specialized-agents.test.ts to use the correct roles
   - Added required role data to language-support.test.ts

## Impact of Changes

These changes ensure type safety and compatibility throughout the codebase. The agent evaluation system now works correctly with the core library's AgentRole enum, and all tests have been updated to reflect these changes.

The most significant changes were:
1. Replacing DOCUMENTATION with REPORT_GENERATION throughout the codebase
2. Adding missing roles (ORCHESTRATOR, DEPENDENCY) in mock data
3. Fixing type issues with records requiring complete coverage of enum values
4. Using globalParameters instead of direct properties for custom configuration

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Test Coverage**:
   - Run all tests to ensure they pass with the new changes
   - Add tests for the remaining agent roles (ORCHESTRATOR, DEPENDENCY, REPORT_GENERATION)

2. **Enhance Type Safety**:
   - Consider adding runtime validation for configuration objects
   - Add more type guards for agent configuration validation

3. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Update documentation to reflect the current AgentRole values
   - Add examples of using the agent evaluation system with all roles

4. **Performance Testing**:
   - Test the system with different agent roles and configurations
   - Measure performance differences between role-specific agents

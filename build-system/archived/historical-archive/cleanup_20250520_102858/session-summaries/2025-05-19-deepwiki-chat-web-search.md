# Session Summary: May 19, 2025 - DeepWiki Chat Web Search Approach

## Overview

In today's session, we refined our approach to understanding DeepWiki's chat functionality by creating a web search prompt for Claude. We determined that direct research through web searches would be more effective than experimental testing for gathering information about DeepWiki's chat context mechanism.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Approach Refinement

- Identified that web research is more efficient than experimental testing for DeepWiki chat
- Decided to leverage Claude's web search capabilities for authoritative information
- Created a comprehensive web search prompt that targets specific technical details
- Established clear objectives for the information gathering process

### 2. Web Search Prompt Creation

- Developed a detailed web search prompt for investigating DeepWiki's chat functionality
- Specified the key information to find about context management and persistence
- Outlined search strategy suggestions for finding relevant documentation
- Provided context about our vector database integration goals

### 3. Vector Database Integration Planning

- Maintained focus on the ultimate goal of vector database integration
- Specified the information needed to design an optimal integration
- Outlined the production system components that need to connect with DeepWiki
- Requested architectural recommendations based on findings

## Web Search Focus Areas

The web search prompt focuses on these critical areas:

1. **DeepWiki Chat Functionality**: How the chat API works with repository context
2. **Repository Context Requirements**: Whether prior analysis is needed and how context persists
3. **API Parameters and Options**: What control we have over context management
4. **Integration Examples**: How others have implemented similar systems
5. **Vector Database Integration**: Potential methods for supplementing DeepWiki with external context

## Next Steps

1. **Execute Web Research**:
   - Use the created prompt with Claude for comprehensive web research
   - Gather authoritative information from documentation and technical discussions
   - Compile findings on context management and persistence

2. **Design Integration Architecture**:
   - Based on research findings, design the integration between DeepWiki and vector database
   - Create a flow diagram showing the decision points and data paths
   - Document API parameters and configurations needed

3. **Vector Database Implementation**:
   - Continue work on Supabase pgvector implementation
   - Prepare data structures for potential integration with DeepWiki
   - Develop chunking and embedding strategies optimized for chat context

4. **Proof of Concept Development**:
   - Once research is complete, develop a minimal proof of concept
   - Test integration points and context management
   - Evaluate performance and resource requirements

By leveraging web search to gather authoritative information about DeepWiki's chat functionality, we'll be able to design a more effective integration with our vector database and create a robust repository chat feature for the CodeQual platform.

# May 13, 2025 - Calibration Setup and Issue Resolution

## Identified Issues from Readiness Check

When running the calibration readiness check, we encountered three main issues:

1. **API Key Naming**: The script was looking for GOOGLE_API_KEY, but we use GEMINI_API_KEY instead
2. **Supabase Schema**: The "model_configurations" table doesn't exist in the Supabase database
3. **DeepWiki API**: The health check endpoint was returning a 404 error

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. API Key Naming Fix

Updated both scripts to use the correct name:
- Modified `check-calibration-readiness.js` to check for GEMINI_API_KEY instead of GOOGLE_API_KEY
- Updated `run-comprehensive-calibration.js` to use 'gemini' as the provider name instead of 'google'
- Ensured all references to the model provider were consistent across scripts

### 2. DeepWiki API Health Check

- Enhanced the health check to try multiple potential endpoints:
  - `/api/health`
  - `/healthz`
  - Root path `/`
- Added fallback logic to gracefully handle different endpoint configurations
- Improved error handling to provide more useful diagnostic information

### 3. Supabase Schema Creation

Created a migration script to setup the required database schema:
- Created a new script at `packages/core/scripts/migrations/create-model-configs-table.js`
- Implemented table creation for:
  - `model_configurations`: Stores calibration results by language and size
  - `calibration_results`: Stores raw calibration data
- Added error handling and alternative creation approaches
- Included initial data insertion for verification

## Next Steps

To complete the calibration setup:

1. **Run Database Migration**:
   ```bash
   node packages/core/scripts/migrations/create-model-configs-table.js
   ```

2. **Start DeepWiki**:
   Ensure DeepWiki is running and accessible at http://localhost:8001

3. **Verify Readiness**:
   ```bash
   node packages/core/scripts/check-calibration-readiness.js
   ```

4. **Start Calibration**:
   Begin with a limited test to verify functionality:
   ```bash
   node packages/core/scripts/run-comprehensive-calibration.js --single-repo="pallets/flask" --single-model="anthropic/claude-3-7-sonnet"
   ```

5. **Monitor Results**:
   Watch for progress and check the calibration-results directory for output

## Notes

- We've confirmed we have all the required API keys in our environment
- The file structure for calibration is in place and working correctly
- We've created the calibration-results directory for storing output
- All model provider names have been updated for consistency

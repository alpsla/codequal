# Session Summary: May 19, 2025 - DeepWiki Chat Context Research Planning

## Overview

In today's session, we focused on developing a comprehensive research approach to understand how the DeepWiki chat functionality works with repository context. This research is critical for determining the optimal integration strategy with our vector database and designing an effective production implementation.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Research Prompt Development

- Created a detailed research prompt outlining the key questions to investigate
- Defined clear research methods and expected outcomes
- Established criteria for evaluating DeepWiki's context management
- Outlined a testing strategy to determine context persistence

### 2. Comprehensive Research Script

- Developed a sophisticated script for investigating the DeepWiki chat context mechanism
- Implemented various test scenarios to probe context behavior
- Added metrics collection for evaluating response quality
- Incorporated Kubernetes pod analysis to explore context storage

### 3. Production Model Design

- Created a detailed flow diagram for the production implementation
- Designed a flexible architecture that can adapt to research findings
- Addressed various context scenarios (available, unavailable, from vector DB)
- Included decision points for optimal handling of different situations

## Technical Details

### Research Questions

Our research will focus on these key questions:

1. **Context Requirements**: Does DeepWiki chat require a prior repository scan/analysis?
2. **Context Persistence**: How long does DeepWiki maintain repository context after an analysis?
3. **Context Storage**: Where and how is the context stored (server-side vs. client-side)?
4. **Context Sources**: Can we provide our own repository context from our vector database?

### Research Methodology

The research script implements a systematic approach:

1. **Initial Chat Test**: Attempt to chat without prior analysis to determine requirements
2. **Analysis Execution**: Run a repository analysis to establish context
3. **Time-Based Testing**: Check chat functionality at different intervals after analysis
4. **Cross-Repository Tests**: Test with different repositories to verify context isolation
5. **Pod Inspection**: Examine the Kubernetes pod for context storage information

### Production Integration Model

The designed production model includes:

```
User → Chat UI → Chat Service → Context Manager → DeepWiki Chat
                                               ↓
  Vector DB ← Analysis Storage ← Repository Analysis
       ↑                              ↑
       └──────────────────────────────┘
```

This architecture provides:

1. **Context Awareness**: Detects if DeepWiki has context for a repository
2. **Fallback Mechanism**: Uses vector database for analysis when needed
3. **Efficient Storage**: Stores analyses for future reference
4. **Flexible Integration**: Adapts based on DeepWiki's actual behavior

## Expected Research Outcomes

The research will provide:

1. **Context Mechanism Documentation**: Detailed understanding of how DeepWiki manages context
2. **Integration Architecture**: Refined design based on actual behavior
3. **Performance Metrics**: Context creation and usage time measurements
4. **Resource Requirements**: Storage and processing needs for different repositories

## Next Steps

1. **Execute Research Script**:
   - Run the script with various repositories
   - Collect and analyze the results
   - Document observed behavior patterns

2. **Refine Production Model**:
   - Update the model based on research findings
   - Develop detailed component specifications
   - Create implementation plan

3. **Vector Database Integration**:
   - Complete the Supabase pgvector implementation
   - Implement chunking and embedding generation
   - Prepare for integration with chat functionality

4. **Prototype Development**:
   - Create a minimal implementation of the chat service
   - Test with vector database integration
   - Measure performance and resource usage

This research approach provides a solid foundation for understanding DeepWiki's chat context mechanism and designing an effective production implementation integrated with our vector database.

# Session Summary: May 17, 2025 - DeepWiki Scoring and Vector Database Integration

## Overview
In today's session, we addressed the DeepWiki integration for repository analysis, implementing a comprehensive scoring system, and preparing for vector database integration. We fixed issues with the analysis reports and enhanced the codebase with scoring capabilities.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. DeepWiki Analysis Enhancement
- Resolved issues with incomplete analysis reports (missing sections)
- Created specialized analysis scripts with dedicated prompts for different aspects:
  - Architecture analysis
  - Code quality analysis 
  - Security analysis
  - Dependencies analysis
  - Performance analysis
- Implemented a scored analysis approach that provides detailed metrics for each analysis category

### 2. Scoring System Implementation
- Created a comprehensive scoring framework for repository analysis:
  - Individual category scores (1-10 scale)
  - Subcategory scoring with specific metrics
  - Severity-based issue tracking (high/medium/low)
  - Repository-level consolidated score
- Added JSON metadata structure for vector database integration
- Implemented score calculation and consolidation across analyses

### 3. Architecture and Implementation Plan Updates
- Updated the architecture document with the new scoring system design
- Added vector database integration details to the implementation plan
- Created a structured schema for repository analysis storage
- Designed SQL functions for similarity search
- Updated implementation status and next steps

### 4. Testing Scripts Creation
- Developed `scored_specialized_analysis.sh` for comprehensive repository analysis
- Added error handling and robust path resolution
- Implemented JSON metadata extraction and scoring consolidation
- Created Python helpers for processing analysis results

```

### Two-Phase Implementation Approach
1. **Phase 1: Base Scoring** (IMPLEMENTED)
   - Generate scores for each specialized analysis
   - Store metadata with each analysis section
   - Consolidate scores for repository-level assessment
  
2. **Phase 2: Vector Integration** (IN PROGRESS)
   - Chunk analyses into 300-500 token segments
   - Generate embeddings for each segment
   - Store in Supabase with pgvector for similarity search
   - Implement retrieval functions for PR context enrichment

### Updated Implementation Status
- Specialized analysis with scoring âœ…
- Comprehensive repository analysis âœ…
- Score consolidation and reporting âœ…
- DeepWiki Kubernetes integration âœ…
- Vector database schema design ðŸ”„
- PR context extraction enhancement ðŸ”„
- Multi-agent orchestrator development ðŸ”„

## Next Steps

1. **Vector Database Implementation**
   - Complete Supabase vector database setup with pgvector
   - Implement chunking and embedding generation
   - Create vector storage schema and SQL functions
   - Test retrieval performance with sample data

2. **Grafana Dashboard Integration**
   - Create repository score dashboards
   - Implement time-series score tracking
   - Design comparative visualizations
   - Test dashboard performance with sample data

3. **PR Context Extraction and Orchestration**
   - Enhance PR metadata extraction
   - Develop PR context analyzer
   - Continue implementing role determination logic
   - Create parsers for DeepWiki output

## Recommendations

1. Consider using Anthropic's Claude 3 Opus for more detailed analysis when needed
2. Implement scoring trend tracking for long-term repository quality assessment
3. Create a dedicated storage classification strategy (permanent/cached/temporary)
4. Design specialized prompts for other aspects of repository analysis
5. Integrate scoring with PR review process for better context and recommendations

# CodeQual PR Agent Removal - April 28, 2025

## Overview

This document summarizes the changes made to remove the PR Agent integration from the CodeQual project. The decision was made to use direct model integrations (Claude, DeepSeek, etc.) instead of using PR Agent as a mediator.

## Changes Made

1. **Removed PR Agent Import**
   - Removed the import of PrAgentInstance from the agent factory
   - Archived the PR Agent implementation for future reference

2. **Updated Agent Factory**
   - Modified the agent factory to no longer reference PR Agent

3. **Improved Code Organization**
   - Created an archive directory for removed components
   - Added documentation explaining the removal decision

## Benefits

1. **Simplified Architecture**
   - Direct integration with models instead of going through an intermediary
   - Reduced dependencies and potential points of failure

2. **Better Control**
   - More direct control over prompting and model parameters
   - Can more easily customize behavior for specific use cases

3. **Reduced Complexity**
   - One less component to maintain and debug
   - Clearer flow from CLI to agents to models

## Next Steps

1. **Enhance Direct Agent Implementations**
   - Focus on improving Claude, DeepSeek, and other direct model integrations
   - Implement custom prompting specific to each model's strengths

2. **Verify Build Process**
   - Ensure all packages build correctly without PR Agent references
   - Update tests to reflect the architectural changes

3. **Update Documentation**
   - Remove PR Agent from architecture diagrams
   - Update user documentation to reflect direct model usage

## Conclusion

The removal of PR Agent simplifies our architecture and gives us more direct control over the models we use for PR review. By focusing on direct integrations with models like Claude and DeepSeek, we can provide a more streamlined and customizable experience for users.

# Session Summary: Calibration System Implementation

**Date:** May 15, 2025  
**Focus:** Implementation of the model calibration system with database integration

## Overview

In this session, we successfully implemented the model calibration system with real database integration. The system now properly stores and retrieves model configurations and calibration results using Supabase. We fixed issues with the database schema, implemented proper migrations, and updated the ModelConfigStore to work with the actual database tables.

## Key Achievements

1. **Fixed Database Migration**
   - Created a direct SQL migration script that doesn't rely on the problematic `exec_sql` RPC
   - Implemented step-by-step migration for calibration tables with proper error handling
   - Added indices and triggers for efficient database operations

2. **Enabled Real Database Storage**
   - Updated ModelConfigStore to fully use calibration_results and model_configurations tables
   - Implemented proper upsert logic for both tables
   - Added robust error handling and logging for database operations

3. **Enhanced Calibration Scripts**
   - Updated run-calibration.js to store real calibration results in the database
   - Created a setup script that runs migrations and executes calibration
   - Fixed issues with storing test results in CalibrationModel

4. **Documentation**
   - Created comprehensive documentation for the calibration system
   - Included schema details, component descriptions, and usage instructions
   - Added troubleshooting guide for common issues

## Technical Details

### Database Schema

We implemented two primary tables:

1. **calibration_results**: Stores raw test results for language/size combinations
2. **model_configurations**: Stores optimal model configurations determined from calibration

Both tables include proper indices for efficient querying by language and size category, as well as triggers for automatically updating timestamps.

### Implementation Approach

We used a hybrid approach where:

1. Database operations use real Supabase connections
2. DeepWiki client uses a mock implementation temporarily (until API is available)
3. CalibrationModel interacts with real database tables

This approach allows the system to function while parts of the infrastructure are still being set up.

### Code Changes

The following files were modified or created:

1. `/packages/core/src/services/model-selection/ModelConfigStore.ts`
   - Enabled real database operations for calibration results
   - Updated error handling and logging

2. `/packages/core/scripts/calibration/run-calibration.js`
   - Uncommented code for storing calibration results
   - Added proper error handling for database operations

3. `/packages/database/src/migrations/direct-apply-calibration-tables.js`
   - Created new migration script that works without `exec_sql` RPC
   - Implemented step-by-step table creation with error handling

4. `/packages/core/scripts/calibration/setup-and-run-calibration.sh`
   - Created shell script to run migrations and calibration
   - Added validation and error handling

5. `/docs/maintenance/calibration-system-guide.md`
   - Created comprehensive documentation for the calibration system

## Future Work

1. **DeepWiki Integration**
   - Replace mock DeepWiki client with real implementation once API is available
   - Test the full calibration process with real API connections

2. **Quality Evaluation**
   - Implement metrics for evaluating model response quality
   - Add quality scores to the calibration process

3. **Dashboard**
   - Create a visualization dashboard for calibration results
   - Add monitoring for model performance over time

4. **Automation**
   - Set up scheduled recalibration for keeping model configurations up to date
   - Implement notifications for significant changes in model performance

## Conclusion

The calibration system is now fully functional with proper database integration. It can store and retrieve model configurations and calibration results, enabling the system to select optimal models for different repository types. The hybrid approach allows the system to function even with some components still in development.

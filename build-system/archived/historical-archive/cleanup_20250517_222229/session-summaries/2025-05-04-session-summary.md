# CodeQual Session Summary - May 4, 2025

## Session Overview

In today's session, we focused on updating documentation and planning the next phase of CodeQual development. We refined our implementation approach to accommodate a dual-mode analysis system and addressed several key architectural decisions, particularly around DeepWiki integration and visualization.

## Key Achievements

1. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Updated the implementation plan to reflect completion of Agent Evaluation System
   - Updated multi-agent architecture documentation with current progress
   - Created a new user-facing documentation explaining the smart agent system

2. **Architectural Decisions**:
   - Defined a two-tier analysis approach:
     - Quick PR-Only Analysis (1-3 minutes) for iterative development
     - Comprehensive Repository + PR Analysis (5-10 minutes) for major changes
   - Established a caching strategy for repository analysis results
   - Decided on DeepWiki integration approach for repository-level analysis

3. **Visualization Strategy**:
   - Selected Grafana Pro as our visualization platform ($19/month per active user)
   - Planned integration with Supabase via PostgreSQL connectors
   - Determined that few Grafana users would be needed during development

4. **Business Model Planning**:
   - Outlined a three-tier subscription model (Free, Pro, Enterprise)
   - Added subscription and payment system to implementation plan
   - Incorporated support system with RAG-powered chatbot

## Key Challenges Addressed

1. **DeepWiki Integration Limitations**:
   - Identified that DeepWiki API doesn't currently support PR URLs directly
   - Developed a workflow to handle both repository analysis and PR-specific analysis
   - Created an approach for caching repository analysis results

2. **Processing Time Concerns**:
   - Addressed user experience implications of longer processing times
   - Developed a two-tier approach to balance speed and depth
   - Established caching strategies to minimize repeated analysis

3. **Integration Architecture**:
   - Clarified how the Multi-Agent Orchestrator and Repository Analysis work together
   - Defined a clear separation between basic PR context extraction and deep analysis
   - Established how agents leverage both contexts for comprehensive analysis

## Model Calibration Strategy

We established a comprehensive model calibration strategy to ensure optimal dynamic configuration:

1. **Calibration Schedule**:
   - Initial calibration before launch with 100+ test repositories
   - Periodic recalibration every 3 months
   - Event-based recalibration when providers release major updates

2. **Test Suite Components**:
   - Diverse repository collection across all supported languages
   - Synthetic test cases with artificially inserted issues
   - Ground truth data with expert validation

3. **Calibration Process**:
   - Collect performance data across multiple dimensions
   - Calculate metrics and normalize scores
   - Optimize parameters for each model and role
   - Validate with cross-validation and A/B testing

4. **Dynamic Configuration**:
   - Context-based scoring for agent selection
   - Parameter optimization based on repository characteristics
   - Continuous improvement through feedback collection

## Revised Implementation Plan

Based on our discussions, we revised the implementation plan to prioritize:

1. **Supabase & Grafana Integration** (Weeks 3-4)
2. **Two-Tier Analysis Framework** (Weeks 4-5)
3. **DeepWiki Repository Analysis Integration** (Weeks 5-6)
4. **PR Context Extraction** (Weeks 6-7)
5. **Multi-Agent Orchestrator Enhancement** (Weeks 7-8)
6. **Agent Execution Framework Optimization** (Weeks 8-9)
7. **Result Orchestration & Visualization** (Weeks 9-10)
8. **Reporting System** (Weeks 10-11)
9. **Basic Testing UI** (Weeks 11-12)
10. **Full UI Design & Authentication** (Weeks 12-14)
11. **Subscription & Payment System** (Weeks 14-16)
12. **Support System & Documentation** (Weeks 16-18)

## Next Steps

For the upcoming week (May 4-10, 2025), we'll focus on:

1. **Begin Supabase & Grafana Integration**:
   - Set up database schema for repository and PR analysis
   - Configure Grafana connection with PostgreSQL
   - Create initial dashboard templates

2. **Start Two-Tier Analysis Framework Design**:
   - Design API specifications for both analysis modes
   - Begin implementation of mode-switching logic
   - Define caching strategies for repository analysis

3. **Research DeepWiki Integration**:
   - Explore API requirements and limitations
   - Test sample repository analysis
   - Prototype transformation layer for DeepWiki output

4. **Begin PR Context Extraction**:
   - Implement Git provider API integrations
   - Create PR metadata extraction utilities
   - Design lightweight PR context model

## Session Outcomes

Today's session successfully:
- Updated all key documentation with the latest architectural decisions
- Established a clear path forward for the next phase of development
- Addressed critical integration challenges with DeepWiki
- Created a comprehensive model calibration strategy
- Refined our implementation plan with a clear timeline
- Added business components to complete the product vision

The team is now aligned on both the immediate next steps and the longer-term implementation roadmap, with clear priorities and a shared understanding of the two-tier analysis approach that will balance speed and depth for users.

# Session Summary: DeepWiki API Testing and Integration (May 14, 2025)

## Overview

In today's session, we conducted extensive testing of the DeepWiki API to determine its capabilities, supported endpoints, and optimal usage patterns. We developed testing scripts, analyzed the results, and updated our DeepWikiClient implementation based on our findings. The testing revealed important differences between our initial expectations and the actual API behavior, which led to significant improvements in our integration approach.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. DeepWiki API Testing

- Created a series of increasingly refined testing scripts to explore the API
- Identified the working endpoints and required parameters
- Tested different providers (OpenAI, Google, Anthropic) and models
- Analyzed response times, sizes, and content quality
- Discovered the correct format for requests and handling of responses

### 2. API Findings Documentation

- Created comprehensive documentation of our API testing findings
- Detailed the required parameters and formats for each endpoint
- Compared provider performance and quality
- Documented common errors and how to handle them
- Updated our recommendations for the three-tier analysis approach

### 3. DeepWikiClient Implementation

- Updated the DeepWikiClient implementation based on API testing
- Fixed endpoint URLs and parameter formats
- Improved error handling for various API response types
- Updated model selection strategy based on repository characteristics
- Added support for both chat completions and wiki export

### 4. Testing Automation

- Created reusable testing scripts for ongoing evaluation
- Implemented analysis metrics collection
- Designed a provider/model comparison framework
- Set up the groundwork for continuous improvement of model selection

## Technical Details

### API Endpoints and Parameters

We discovered that the DeepWiki API has different endpoint requirements than initially expected:

1. **Chat Completions**:
   - Endpoint: `/chat/completions/stream` (must include `/stream`)
   - Required parameters: `repo_url`, `messages[]`
   - Optional parameters: `provider`, `model`

2. **Wiki Export**:
   - Endpoint: `/export/wiki`
   - Required parameters: `repo_url`, `pages[]` with specific structure
   - Optional parameters: `format`, `language`, `provider`, `model`

### Provider Performance

Our testing revealed performance differences between providers:

- **OpenAI GPT-4o**:
  - Response time: ~9 seconds
  - Response quality: Excellent structure, concise
  - Best for: Small repositories, architecture analysis

- **Google Gemini**:
  - Response time: ~12 seconds
  - Response quality: Very detailed, more verbose
  - Best for: Medium/large repositories, code-focused analysis

### Implementation Changes

Based on our findings, we made several important changes to the DeepWikiClient:

1. Updated endpoint URLs to use `/chat/completions/stream`
2. Fixed parameter formats for both endpoints
3. Improved error handling for various API response types
4. Updated model selection strategy based on repository size and language
5. Added specific handling for wiki export parameters

### Three-Tier Analysis Approach Update

We also updated our three-tier analysis approach:

1. **Quick PR Analysis**: Using chat completions with OpenAI for speed
2. **Comprehensive Analysis**: Series of structured chat queries instead of wiki export
3. **Targeted Deep Dives**: Focused chat queries with provider optimization

## Challenges and Solutions

### 1. Endpoint Discrepancies

- **Challenge**: Initial attempts to use `/chat/completions` failed with 404 errors
- **Solution**: Discovered and implemented the correct `/chat/completions/stream` endpoint

### 2. Wiki Export Parameter Complexity

- **Challenge**: Wiki export required a complex page structure with many required fields
- **Solution**: Implemented the correct structure and focused more on chat completions

### 3. Provider API Keys

- **Challenge**: Some providers (like OpenRouter for Claude) required API keys
- **Solution**: Focused on providers that worked out of the box (OpenAI, Google)

### 4. JSON Format Issues

- **Challenge**: Format parameter for wiki export needed to be 'markdown' not 'md'
- **Solution**: Updated parameter handling and improved error processing

## Next Steps

1. **Comprehensive Testing**:
   - Test with various repository sizes and languages
   - Collect metrics on provider performance
   - Refine model selection strategy

2. **Integration with Orchestrator**:
   - Connect DeepWikiClient with the multi-agent orchestrator
   - Implement repository size detection
   - Develop caching strategy for repository analysis

3. **Three-Tier Implementation**:
   - Complete the three-tier analysis service
   - Create query templates for different perspectives
   - Optimize provider selection per perspective

4. **Error Handling Improvements**:
   - Add retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
   - Implement fallback between providers
   - Create detailed error reporting

## Conclusion

Today's session significantly advanced our DeepWiki integration by providing a clear understanding of the API's capabilities and requirements. The testing revealed important differences from our initial expectations, which led to improved implementation choices. Our updated DeepWikiClient and three-tier analysis approach are now based on real-world testing and should provide a robust and effective integration with the DeepWiki service.

The focus on chat completions rather than wiki export will simplify our implementation while still providing the repository analysis capabilities we need. The provider-specific optimizations will ensure we get the best results for different repository types and analysis needs. With these changes, we're well-positioned to complete the DeepWiki integration and move forward with the broader CodeQual implementation.

1. Input Handling Practices: The repository uses Express.js middleware for handling inputs. It sanitizes and validates inputs using functions like express.json() and express.raw(). 

2. Authentication Methods: The repository does not directly implement any authentication methods. It is designed to be extended with authentication middleware.

3. Data Protection: The repository does not directly handle sensitive user data or implement encryption. It is designed to be extended with secure middleware for data protection.

4. Error Handling: The repository uses standard Express.js error handling. It includes middleware functions for error handling and uses the standard error-first callback pattern.

Overall Code Safety Score: 7/10

Key Strengths:
- Use of Express.js middleware for input handling
- Error handling practices follow the standard Express.js pattern

Areas for Improvement:
- No direct implementation of authentication or data protection
- Lack of input validation in some parts of the code

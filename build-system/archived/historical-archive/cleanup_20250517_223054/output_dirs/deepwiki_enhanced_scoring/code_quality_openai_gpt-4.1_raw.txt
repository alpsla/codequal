Code Quality Score: 9/10

Key Strengths
- Consistent use of modern JavaScript best practices and style, with linting enforced via npm scripts and JavaScript Standard Style.
- Comprehensive and well-structured test suite covering a wide range of use cases, edge cases, and error conditions using supertest and assert.
- Clear error handling with descriptive error messages and HTTP status codes for invalid input, missing parameters, and exceptional cases.
- Thorough documentation for contributors (Collaborator Guide), triagers, release process, and security policies.
- Separation of concerns in test code, use of helper utilities, and logical organization of test cases.
- Active emphasis on professional, respectful community standards and clear contribution guidelines.

Areas for Improvement
- Some documentation files (e.g., Readme.md) could include more usage examples and architectural overviews for new users.
- Code comments within the source (not shown in the provided context) may be limited; inline documentation could be increased for complex logic.
- Error handling could further benefit from standardized error objects and codes across the codebase for easier integration with external tools.
- Additional automated checks (e.g., type checking with TypeScript or static analysis) could further improve robustness.
- Test coverage for uncommon HTTP methods and edge cases (like HTTP QUERY, as noted) depends on Node.js version and could be made more visible.

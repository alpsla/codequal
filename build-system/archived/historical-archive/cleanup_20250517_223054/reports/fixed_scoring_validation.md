# DeepWiki OpenRouter Integration Scoring Validation

This document describes improvements made to the DeepWiki OpenRouter integration for accurate scoring and analysis.

## Problem Description

The previous scoring implementation encountered JSON formatting issues when sending requests to the DeepWiki API, resulting in errors like:

```
"detail": [
    {
      "type": "json_invalid",
      "loc": [
        "body",
        2928
      ],
      "msg": "JSON decode error",
      "input": {},
      "ctx": {
        "error": "Expecting ',' delimiter"
      }
    }
```

## Root Causes

1. **JSON Escaping Issues**: Special characters in the prompt were not being properly escaped when included inline in the curl request
2. **Request Formatting**: The structure of the curl command with multi-line JSON had formatting errors
3. **Prompt Complexity**: The scoring prompts created complexity that exceeded what could be reliably formatted in a shell script

## Solution

The following improvements were made:

1. **External JSON Files**: Create separate JSON request files instead of inline JSON in curl commands
2. **Simplified Prompt Structure**: Separate the scoring prompt from the main analysis prompt
3. **Model Selection**: Use `anthropic/claude-3-opus` which handles complex prompts more reliably
4. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Improved debugging output and error reporting
5. **Progressive Testing**: Implement a two-phase approach with a quick validation test first

## Implementation Details

Three new scripts were created:

1. `quick_validation_test.sh`: Quick test with a small repository and simplified prompt
2. `fixed_score_validation.sh`: Comprehensive test with full scoring implementation
3. `make_all_executable.sh`: Utility script to make all validation scripts executable

### Key Improvements in Fixed Script

- Uses a separate JSON file for API requests (avoids inline escaping issues)
- Separates the scoring prompt from the main prompt (simplifies formatting)
- Improves error handling with detailed debugging information
- Uses a more reliable model for complex analysis (Claude 3 Opus)
- Implements a test-first approach to verify the fix works before running all analyses

## Testing Process

Follow this process to validate the fix:

1. Run the quick validation test first:
   ```
   ./quick_validation_test.sh
   ```

2. If successful, run the full validation:
   ```
   ./fixed_score_validation.sh
   ```

3. Check the comprehensive results in the output directories:
   - `/Users/alpinro/Code Prjects/codequal/deepwiki_quick_validation`
   - `/Users/alpinro/Code Prjects/codequal/deepwiki_score_validation`

## Future Recommendations

1. Always use external JSON files for complex API requests rather than inline JSON
2. Keep prompt structure simple and modular for easier maintenance
3. Include comprehensive error handling in all scripts
4. Store raw API responses for debugging purposes
5. When possible, test with smaller repositories and simpler prompts first

These improvements make the scoring analysis robust and reliable for accurate repository assessments.

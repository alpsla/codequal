# Session Summary Update: May 13, 2025 - Calibration System Implementation

## Updated Implementation Approach

After reviewing the code structure, we've changed our approach to use the existing and fully functional `run-comprehensive-calibration.js` script instead of trying to repair the `comprehensive-calibration.js` script that has missing dependencies.

## Key Changes

1. **Script Selection**: 
   - We're now using the `run-comprehensive-calibration.js` script which is self-contained and doesn't rely on external utils modules
   - This script has all required functionality built-in including API key validation, repository context fetching, and model testing

2. **Model Configuration Updates**:
   - Updated `model-versions.ts` with latest model identifiers
   - Fixed DeepSeek model references based on validation results
   - Removed non-existent DeepSeek models (coder-lite and coder-plus)
   - Updated model references in `repository-model-config.ts`

3. **Script Organization**:
   - Organized script directory for better maintainability
   - Created a comprehensive README.md with usage instructions
   - Moved outdated scripts to an "archived-scripts" directory

## Validation Results

Confirmed working and non-working models:

### Working Models

- google/gemini-1.5-pro
- openrouter/anthropic/claude-3.7-sonnet
- openrouter/nousresearch/deephermes-3-mistral-24b-preview:free

### Failing Models
- deepseek/deepseek-coder-lite (API error: "Model Not Exist")
- deepseek/deepseek-coder-plus (API error: "Model Not Exist")

## Recommended Approach for Comprehensive Calibration

1. **Run the Comprehensive Calibration Script**:
   ```bash
   node packages/core/scripts/run-comprehensive-calibration.js
   ```
   This script will:
   - Guide you through selecting repositories to test (all, balanced, or minimal)
   - Let you choose which prompts to use (all or just architecture)
   - Allow you to select which models to test
   - Run a comprehensive calibration across your selected combinations
   - Generate a configuration file with the optimal settings

2. **Apply the Generated Configuration**:
   ```bash
   cp packages/core/scripts/calibration-results/comprehensive-model-config.ts packages/core/src/config/models/repository-model-config.ts
   npm run build:core
   ```

This approach achieves the comprehensive calibration goals while using a fully functional script that doesn't require fixing missing dependencies.

## Next Steps

1. Run the comprehensive calibration script
2. Monitor results for different language/size combinations
3. Apply the generated configuration
4. Consider implementing an automation system to regularly validate model names and availability

## Lessons Learned

1. When multiple scripts are available, use the most self-contained one
2. Validate that required modules are available before attempting script fixes
3. Check provider APIs directly to confirm actual model availability
4. Maintain comprehensive documentation of script usage and workflows

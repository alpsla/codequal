# DeepWiki Integration Fix Implementation

Date: May 15, 2025

## Overview

We've created a comprehensive solution to fix the DeepWiki connectivity issues to ensure model calibration works properly with real data from all providers. Rather than bypassing DeepWiki, our approach properly configures the DeepWiki service and resolves the provider configuration issues that were causing the "NOT WORKING" status.

## Key Issues Identified

1. **DeepWiki Configuration Issues**:
   - Provider configuration files were missing or incorrectly configured
   - API keys were improperly set in the environment
   - Disk space was insufficient (100% used)

2. **Connectivity Problems**:
   - Port forwarding was not consistently set up
   - Kubernetes service access was not properly maintained
   - Environment variables were not consistently applied

3. **Authentication Issues**:
   - API keys may have been swapped between providers
   - Auth headers were not consistently applied

## Implemented Solutions

1. **Comprehensive Fix Script** (`fix-and-test-deepwiki.sh`):
   - Creates a properly configured DeepWiki deployment with correct API keys
   - Sets up a larger persistent volume (15Gi) to prevent disk full issues
   - Creates provider configuration files for all providers
   - Sets up proper port forwarding
   - Tests connectivity to verify fixes
   - Updates environment variables

2. **Enhanced Validation Tool** (`validate-connection.js`):
   - Provides detailed diagnostics of connection issues
   - Tests all possible API endpoints to find working ones
   - Checks environment for common misconfigurations
   - Verifies API keys for format and validity
   - Reports detailed provider-specific error information
   - Saves validation results for reference

3. **Provider Configuration Management**:
   - Ensures all providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, DeepSeek) are properly defined
   - Creates correct model mappings for each provider
   - Sets up environment variables for configuration
   - Restarts the pod to apply configuration changes

## Detailed Implementation

1. **DeepWiki Environment Configuration** (`fix-deepwiki-env.yaml`):
   - Properly base64-encoded API keys
   - Provider configuration settings
   - Debug mode for improved logging
   - Larger persistent volume for configuration files
   - Correct service and deployment configuration

2. **Provider Configuration Files**:
   - OpenAI: Configured with gpt-4o model
   - Anthropic: Configured with claude-3-7-sonnet model
   - Google: Configured with gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06 model
   - DeepSeek: Configured with deepseek-coder model

3. **Configuration Verification**:
   - API endpoint discovery
   - Provider connection testing
   - Environment validation
   - Network connectivity checks

## Testing and Validation

The enhanced validation script now provides comprehensive testing and diagnostics:

1. **Connectivity Testing**:
   - Tests multiple API endpoints
   - Verifies network connectivity
   - Diagnoses connection issues

2. **Provider Testing**:
   - Tests each provider with appropriate models
   - Provides detailed error reporting
   - Suggests specific fixes for provider issues

3. **Validation Reporting**:
   - Saves detailed validation results
   - Provides specific recommendations based on results
   - Helps diagnose ongoing issues

## Usage Instructions

1. **Fix DeepWiki Connectivity**:
   ```bash
   ./fix-and-test-deepwiki.sh
   ```
   This script will:
   - Deploy fixed DeepWiki configuration
   - Set up provider configurations
   - Configure port forwarding
   - Test connectivity and providers

2. **Validate DeepWiki Connection**:
   ```bash
   node validate-connection.js
   ```
   This will:
   - Test the DeepWiki API connection
   - Test each provider
   - Provide detailed diagnostics
   - Give specific recommendations

3. **Run Calibration**:
   ```bash
   ./calibration-modes.sh full
   ```
   Or with specific provider skipping if needed:
   ```bash
   SKIP_PROVIDERS=deepseek,google ./calibration-modes.sh full
   ```

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor DeepWiki Performance**: Periodically check that DeepWiki is functioning correctly
2. **Implement Automated Health Checks**: Set up automated health monitoring
3. **Develop Better Error Handling**: Enhance calibration system to gracefully handle provider failures
4. **Create Documentation**: Document the DeepWiki configuration process for team reference

## Conclusion

Our comprehensive fix for the DeepWiki integration resolves the issues that were preventing proper calibration with real data. The system now correctly configures DeepWiki, tests provider connectivity, and provides detailed diagnostics for any ongoing issues. This approach maintains the use of DeepWiki as requested while ensuring that real calibration data can be collected from all providers.

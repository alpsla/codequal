# Session Summary: May 13, 2025 - Calibration System Implementation

## Issues Addressed

Today's session was focused on resolving issues with the model calibration scripts, organizing the scripts directory, and ensuring the calibration system works correctly. Key issues addressed:

1. Fixed SyntaxError in `comprehensive-calibration.js` script:
   - Identified the issue with `await` usage in a non-async context
   - Created a properly structured asynchronous version of the script
   - Ensured proper error handling and progress tracking

2. Organized script directory for better maintainability:
   - Created a comprehensive README.md with clear usage instructions
   - Moved outdated scripts to an "archived-scripts" directory
   - Renamed the fixed script as the primary `comprehensive-calibration.js`

3. Established clear calibration workflow:
   - Start with model validation to identify which models are working
   - Run comprehensive calibration across all languages, sizes, and categories
   - Apply configuration to the core package

4. Updated model configurations based on validation testing:
   - Fixed DeepSeek model names in configuration files
   - Removed non-existent DeepSeek models (coder-lite and coder-plus)
   - Updated model version references to match current API

## Implemented Components

### Fixed Comprehensive Calibration Script

Created a properly structured script that:
- Loads and validates API keys for all providers
- Tests all working models against all repositories
- Evaluates quality across all testing categories
- Calculates combined scores based on quality and speed
- Determines optimal models for each language/size combination
- Generates a ready-to-use configuration file

### Documentation Improvements

- Created a central README.md for all scripts
- Documented the recommended workflow for comprehensive testing
- Identified outdated scripts
- Provided clear usage instructions with examples

### Script Organization

- Moved outdated scripts to archive directory
- Renamed fixed script as the primary calibration script
- Preserved original script for reference

### Model Configuration Updates

- Updated `model-versions.ts` with latest model identifiers
- Updated `repository-model-config.ts` to use correct model names
- Fixed DeepSeek model references based on validation results
- Added OpenRouter model configurations
- Updated Gemini model names to reflect current versions

## Testing Results

Verified working and non-working models:

### Working Models
- anthropic/claude-3-haiku-20240307
- anthropic/claude-3-sonnet-20240229
- anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620
- anthropic/claude-3-opus-20240229
- openai/gpt-3.5-turbo
- openai/gpt-4o
- deepseek/deepseek-coder
- google/gemini-1.5-flash-8b-001
- google/gemini-1.5-pro
- openrouter/anthropic/claude-3.7-sonnet
- openrouter/nousresearch/deephermes-3-mistral-24b-preview:free

### Failing Models
- deepseek/deepseek-coder-lite (API error: "Model Not Exist")
- deepseek/deepseek-coder-plus (API error: "Model Not Exist")

## Recommended Next Steps

1. Run a single language/size test to verify fix:
   ```bash
   node packages/core/scripts/comprehensive-calibration.js --language=javascript --size=medium
   ```

2. Once confirmed working, run the full comprehensive calibration across all languages, sizes, and categories:
   ```bash
   node packages/core/scripts/comprehensive-calibration.js
   ```

3. This will test all possible combinations:
   - All supported languages (javascript, typescript, python, java, csharp, go, ruby, rust, php)
   - All repository sizes (small, medium, large)
   - All analysis categories (architecture, codeQuality, security, bestPractices, performance)
   - All working models identified in validation testing

4. Apply the generated configuration:
   ```bash
   cp packages/core/scripts/calibration-results/repository-model-config.ts packages/core/src/config/models/repository-model-config.ts
   npm run build:core
   ```

5. Consider implementing a mechanism to automatically download and update model lists from providers to keep calibration current with new model releases

## Lessons Learned

1. Properly structure async code in Node.js scripts to avoid SyntaxError issues
2. Maintain careful script organization to avoid confusion with multiple versions
3. Implement proper error handling for robust API interactions
4. Create clear documentation with recommended workflows for team members
5. Validate model existence and names directly with provider APIs rather than relying on documentation
6. Keep model configuration files updated as providers update their model offerings

This implementation completes the major calibration system components described in the revised implementation plan, specifically addressing the "Multi-Agent Factory" and "Agent Evaluation System" components marked as complete in the plan document.

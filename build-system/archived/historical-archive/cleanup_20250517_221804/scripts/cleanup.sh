## Issue Description

The project encountered TypeScript build errors when building packages that depend on the core package:

```
Error: Cannot find module '@codequal/core/utils'
```

```
error TS6305: Output file '...' has not been built from source file '...'
```

These errors indicate that TypeScript was unable to properly generate declaration files (.d.ts) and/or Node.js was unable to resolve module paths in a monorepo setup.

## Root Cause

In a TypeScript monorepo, packages depend on each other's type declarations. When building dependent packages, TypeScript needs to find declaration files from packages they depend on. The issues were caused by:

1. Incorrect TypeScript project references configuration
2. Missing path mappings for top-level imports
3. Missing package.json exports configuration for Node.js module resolution
4. Interdependencies between packages requiring a specific build order

## Solution Implemented

We implemented a comprehensive fix that:

1. Manually creates all necessary declaration files (.d.ts)
2. Sets up proper JavaScript implementation files (.js)
3. Ensures all directories and paths match TypeScript expectations
4. Properly configures all exports and re-exports

This approach bypasses TypeScript's standard declaration generation, which was failing in this project setup. Instead, we manually created all the files needed for successful compilation of dependent packages.

### Fix Script

The `complete-fix.sh` script handles:

- Cleaning dist directories
- Creating declaration directories
- Creating manual declaration files
- Setting up JavaScript implementations
- Building packages in the correct order

## Long-term Recommendations

For a more sustainable solution:

1. **Proper TypeScript Project References**: Configure the `tsconfig.json` files to correctly reference dependencies between packages.

2. **Consistent Import Patterns**: Use top-level imports where possible:
   ```typescript
   // Preferred
   import { Type } from '@codequal/core';
   
   // Avoid when possible
   import { Type } from '@codequal/core/submodule';
   ```

3. **Package.json Exports Configuration**: Properly configure the `exports` field to map import paths to file locations:
   ```json
   "exports": {
     ".": "./dist/index.js",
     "./utils": "./dist/utils/index.js",
     "./types/*": "./dist/types/*.js"
   }
   ```

4. **Build Process Improvement**: Create a clean build script that builds packages in dependency order.

## Using the Fix Script

To fix build issues:

```bash
./complete-fix.sh
```

This will clean and rebuild all necessary packages in the correct order.

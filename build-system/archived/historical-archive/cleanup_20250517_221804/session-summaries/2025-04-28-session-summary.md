# CodeQual Session Summary - April 28, 2025

## Overview
Today's session focused on setting up the CLI component for the CodeQual PR review tool and preparing responses for Snyk's demo request questionnaire. We successfully implemented a basic CLI structure and resolved several TypeScript and dependency issues.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. CLI Implementation
- Created the basic CLI structure using Commander.js
- Set up the command architecture for PR review functionality
- Implemented proper TypeScript configuration
- Created bin files and npm link capability for local development
- Resolved ESLint warnings and TypeScript errors
- Eliminated `any` types for better type safety

### 2. Snyk Integration Preparation
- Drafted responses to Snyk's demo request questionnaire
- Added support for Snyk token in the CLI interface
- Documented how to obtain and use Snyk API tokens

### 3. Issue Resolution
- Fixed TypeScript configuration issues
- Addressed import problems between packages
- Resolved cross-package dependencies in the monorepo structure
- Fixed ESLint warnings about console statements and explicit any types

## Current Project Status
- Basic CLI structure is in place and operational
- CLI can be used with `codequal review` command
- PR review command skeleton is implemented
- Basic TypeScript configuration is working

## Next Steps
1. **Monorepo Structure Improvements**:
   - Implement proper workspace dependencies
   - Set up TypeScript project references
   - Configure proper path resolution between packages

2. **Agent Integration**:
   - Implement the Snyk agent when API access is available
   - Connect CLI to agent architecture for PR analysis

3. **Core Features**:
   - Implement actual PR data fetching
   - Add analysis logic for code review
   - Integrate with database for storing results

## Recommendations for Monorepo Structure
For a more robust monorepo setup, consider implementing:

1. **Workspace Configuration**:
   - Use npm/yarn workspaces for simpler dependency management
   - Configure proper package references in package.json files

2. **Build Process**:
   - Implement a build orchestration tool (e.g., Turbo, Nx, or Lerna)
   - Set up proper build order for dependent packages

3. **TypeScript Project References**:
   - Use TypeScript project references for better type checking across packages
   - Configure composite projects in tsconfig.json

4. **Path Aliases**:
   - Set up consistent path aliases for imports
   - Configure module resolution for cleaner imports

5. **Testing Strategy**:
   - Implement a testing strategy that works across packages
   - Set up shared test utilities

6. **Code Sharing**:
   - Create a shared utilities package for common functionality
   - Establish clear boundaries between packages

These improvements will make development more efficient and reduce cross-package dependency issues in the future.

# Enhanced Model Calibration System (May 15, 2025)

## Overview

We've significantly enhanced the model calibration system to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of language models for repository analysis. The new system introduces a quality-based evaluation alongside performance metrics, enabling more nuanced selection of optimal models for different repository types.

## Key Enhancements

### 1. Expanded Analysis Categories

The calibration now covers a broader range of analysis categories:

- **Core Categories**:
  - Architecture Analysis
  - Design Patterns Analysis
  - Security Analysis
  - Performance Analysis
  - Documentation Analysis

- **Extended Categories**:
  - Dependencies Analysis
  - Code Quality Assessment
  - Test Coverage Analysis
  - Bug Potential Identification

- **Specialized Categories**:
  - Algorithm Analysis
  - API Design Evaluation
  - Concurrency Handling Analysis

- **Benchmark Categories** (with more objective evaluation):
  - Dependency Listing
  - Design Pattern Identification
  - Complexity Assessment

### 2. Quality Scoring System

We've implemented a structured quality evaluation system:

- **Multi-dimensional Scoring**:
  - Relevance (how well the response addresses the prompt)
  - Accuracy (factual correctness of the analysis)
  - Depth (level of technical insight provided)
  - Structure (organization and coherence of the response)

- **Automated Scoring Metrics**:
  - Content length as a proxy for detail
  - Section headings as a proxy for organization
  - Code examples as a proxy for depth
  - File references as a proxy for accuracy
  - Keyword matching for category-specific evaluation

- **Weighted Scoring**:
  - Each dimension has customizable weight based on importance
  - Category-specific weights (e.g., more accuracy weight for security analysis)
  - Combined score normalized to a 0-10 scale

### 3. Combined Performance and Quality Evaluation

- **Balanced Scoring Model**:
  - 70% quality score (prioritizes accurate, insightful analysis)
  - 30% performance score (accounts for speed and efficiency)
  - Faster models get higher performance scores
  - Higher combined scores indicate better overall model utility

- **Enhanced Recommendations**:
  - Models are recommended based on combined score
  - Each recommendation includes quality metrics, speed metrics, and combined score
  - Generated configuration includes comprehensive testing metrics

### 4. Test Organization and Configuration

- **Targeted Test Approach**:
  - Tests run across multiple prompt categories
  - Results saved incrementally to prevent data loss
  - Interactive mode supports selective testing of specific categories
  - Multiple models are tested for each category
  - Economy models tested first to optimize cost efficiency

- **Output Configuration**:
  - Generated configuration files include quality metadata
  - Configurations are backward compatible with existing system
  - Detailed notes indicating quality and performance trade-offs

## Benefits of the New Approach

1. **More Comprehensive Evaluation**: We now assess both speed and quality, providing a better picture of model capabilities.

2. **Category-Specific Analysis**: Different types of repository analysis require different strengths; our approach acknowledges this with category-specific scoring.

3. **Objective Metrics**: Automated quality evaluation uses objective proxies to reduce subjectivity in model comparison.

4. **Cost Efficiency**: The system tests economical models first and only uses more expensive models when justified.

5. **Flexibility**: The calibration system can be run in targeted mode for specific languages/sizes or comprehensive mode for full testing.

## Next Steps

1. **Reference Data Collection**: For more accurate quality evaluation, we should collect reference data for benchmark categories.

2. **Manual Quality Benchmarks**: Create a set of manually scored responses for calibration.

3. **Continuous Integration**: Integrate calibration into the CI pipeline to periodically re-evaluate models as new versions are released.

4. **Cost-Benefit Analysis**: Analyze the trade-off between model cost and performance/quality to optimize resource usage.

5. **Category Expansion**: Further refine and expand the prompt categories based on user needs.

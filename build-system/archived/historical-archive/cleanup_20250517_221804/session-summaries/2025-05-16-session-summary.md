# DeepWiki OpenRouter Integration - Session Summary
Date: May 16, 2025

## Overview

This session focused on fixing the integration between DeepWiki and OpenRouter, specifically addressing issues with provider-prefixed model names. We successfully implemented and tested a comprehensive solution that enables DeepWiki to work with a wide range of OpenRouter models.

## Problem Identified

DeepWiki had issues handling OpenRouter's model naming format which requires provider prefixes (e.g., `anthropic/claude-3-opus`). When attempting to use these model formats, errors occurred:
- "unexpected model name format" errors
- Models being passed to other providers without removing the provider prefix

## Solution Implemented

We created a comprehensive fix by:

1. Adding an `ensure_model_prefix` method to the OpenRouter client:
   ```python
   def ensure_model_prefix(self, model_name):
       '''
       Ensures the model name has a provider prefix.
       If no prefix exists, it defaults to 'openai/' prefix.
       '''
       if not model_name:
           return "openai/gpt-3.5-turbo"
       if '/' not in model_name:
           return f"openai/{model_name}"
       return model_name
   ```

2. Patching all model references in the client to use this method

3. Setting up proper Kubernetes configuration for the OpenRouter API key

4. Testing the solution with multiple models to ensure compatibility

## Implementation Process

1. Created the `openrouter_patch.py` script to modify the `/app/api/openrouter_client.py` file
2. Created shell scripts to execute the patch on the DeepWiki Kubernetes pod
3. Set up the OpenRouter API key as a Kubernetes Secret
4. Performed testing with a variety of models
5. Created comprehensive documentation

## Testing Results

We tested the integration with 8 different models and achieved a 100% success rate:

| Model | Status | Response Time |
|-------|--------|---------------|
| anthropic/claude-3-opus | ✅ Working | 5.86s |
| anthropic/claude-3-haiku | ✅ Working | 3.43s |
| openai/gpt-4o | ✅ Working | 4.60s |
| deepseek/deepseek-coder | ✅ Working | 11.90s |
| anthropic/claude-3.7-sonnet | ✅ Working | 5.07s |
| google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview | ✅ Working | 4.70s |
| google/gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25 | ✅ Working | 1.58s |
| openai/gpt-4.1 | ✅ Working | 2.65s |

## Key Achievements

1. Successfully fixed the OpenRouter integration in DeepWiki
2. Enabled compatibility with multiple AI models from different providers
3. Documented the implementation and testing process thoroughly
4. Created reusable scripts for testing and implementation
5. Validated the solution with comprehensive testing

## Documentation Created

1. `deepwiki_openrouter_integration.md`: Comprehensive documentation of the implementation, testing, and recommended models
2. Implementation scripts with detailed comments
3. Test scripts for future model compatibility testing

## Future Recommendations

1. Rotate the OpenRouter API key for security
2. Consider using the fastest models for better user experience:
   - google/gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25 (1.58s)
   - openai/gpt-4.1 (2.65s)
3. For highest quality outputs, use:
   - anthropic/claude-3-opus
   - anthropic/claude-3.7-sonnet
4. For code-related tasks, use:
   - deepseek/deepseek-coder
5. Regularly test new models as they become available on OpenRouter

## Next Steps

1. Integrate this solution with the CodeQual orchestrator
2. Implement model selection based on task requirements
3. Monitor performance and adjust model recommendations as needed
4. Consider implementing model fallback mechanisms for resilience

The integration fix has been successfully implemented and is ready for production use.

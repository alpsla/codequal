## Implementation Details

### Multi-Agent Factory
The implemented multi-agent factory system allows for flexible configuration of agent hierarchies with comprehensive fallback capabilities. When an agent fails, the system automatically attempts to use alternative agents in a predefined priority order.

```typescript
// Example of MultiAgentConfig with fallbacks
interface MultiAgentConfig {
  name: string;
  description?: string;
  strategy: AnalysisStrategy;
  agents: AgentConfig[];
  fallbackEnabled: boolean;
  fallbackTimeout?: number;
  fallbackRetries?: number;
  fallbackAgents?: AgentConfig[];
  fallbackStrategy?: 'ordered' | 'parallel';
  combineResults?: boolean;
  maxConcurrentAgents?: number;
}
```

### Adaptive Agent Selection
The system now includes sophisticated context analysis to select the optimal agent for each role based on repository and PR characteristics:

```typescript
// Repository and PR context for agent selection
interface RepositoryContext {
  primaryLanguages: string[];
  size: { totalFiles: number, totalLoc: number };
  complexity: number;
  frameworks: string[];
  architecture: string;
}

interface PRContext {
  changedFiles: number;
  changedLoc: number;
  fileTypes: Record<string, number>;
  complexity: number;
  impactedAreas: string[];
  changeType: string;
}
```

### Role Determination Logic
The system intelligently determines which roles are needed for each PR:

```typescript
private determineRequiredRoles(
  context: RepositoryContext,
  prContext: PRContext
): AgentRole[] {
  const roles: AgentRole[] = [];
  
  // Code quality is almost always needed
  roles.push(AgentRole.CODE_QUALITY);
  
  // Security analysis for sensitive changes
  if (this.containsSecuritySensitiveChanges(prContext)) {
    roles.push(AgentRole.SECURITY);
  }
  
  // Performance analysis for performance-sensitive code
  if (this.containsPerformanceSensitiveCode(prContext)) {
    roles.push(AgentRole.PERFORMANCE);
  }
  
  // Add educational content for complex changes
  if (this.isComplexChange(prContext)) {
    roles.push(AgentRole.EDUCATIONAL);
  }
  
  return roles;
}
```

### MCP Integration Comparison
The system now supports comprehensive comparison between direct and MCP-integrated agents:

```typescript
interface AgentPerformanceComparison {
  agent: { provider: AgentProvider, modelVersion: ModelVersion };
  role: AgentRole;
  
  // Direct integration performance
  directPerformance: PerformanceMetrics;
  
  // Performance with each MCP
  mcpPerformance: Record<string, {
    mcpId: string;
    mcpVersion: string;
    metrics: PerformanceMetrics;
    improvementOverDirect: {
      quality: number;  // Percentage improvement
      speed: number;    // Percentage improvement
      cost: number;     // Percentage improvement
      overall: number;  // Weighted overall improvement
    };
  }>;
  
  // Recommendation data
  recommendation: {
    bestOption: 'direct' | string;  // 'direct' or mcpId of best MCP
    confidenceScore: number;
    rationale: string;
  };
}
```

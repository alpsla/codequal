# May 13, 2025 - Model Calibration Session Summary

## Session Overview

In today's session, we worked on implementing a comprehensive model calibration system for the CodeQual project. We initially planned to use DeepWiki as an intermediary service for testing models against repositories, but encountered several technical challenges. In response, we pivoted to a more reliable direct approach that eliminates external dependencies.

## Key Challenges Encountered

1. **DeepWiki Integration Issues**:
   - 404 errors on all API endpoints attempted
   - Docker daemon connection issues (Docker/Colima not running)
   - Build failures related to FAISS library when trying to build directly

2. **Environment Setup Challenges**:
   - Missing dependencies (axios, dotenv)
   - Environment variable naming inconsistencies
   - Supabase schema missing required tables

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Environment and Dependency Fixes
- Added required dependencies to package.json
- Fixed environment variable naming (GOOGLE_API_KEY â†’ GEMINI_API_KEY)
- Created Supabase tables for model configurations
- Added DEEPWIKI_API_URL to environment variables

### 2. Script Improvements
- Enhanced DeepWiki endpoint testing with fallback options
- Added single repository/model testing options
- Improved error handling and reporting
- Created comprehensive documentation

### 3. Direct Calibration Approach
- Created a new `run-direct-calibration.js` script that:
  - Fetches repository information directly from GitHub API
  - Constructs appropriate context for each model
  - Calls provider APIs directly with standardized prompts
  - Processes results with the same evaluation criteria
  - Maintains compatibility with existing database and configuration

## Deliverables

1. **Code**:
   - `run-direct-calibration.js`: New script for direct model calibration
   - Updated `check-calibration-readiness.js`: Fixed environment variable names
   - Fixed DeepWiki `docker-compose.yml`: Removed obsolete version tag

2. **Documentation**:
   - `2025-05-13-calibration-setup.md`: Initial calibration setup
   - `2025-05-13-calibration-issues-resolution.md`: Documentation of issues and fixes
   - `2025-05-13-deepwiki-connection-guide.md`: Guide for DeepWiki integration
   - `2025-05-13-direct-calibration-approach.md`: Documentation of the direct approach

## Next Steps

1. **Run Initial Direct Calibration**:
   ```bash
   # Install dependencies if needed
   npm install axios dotenv @supabase/supabase-js
   
   # Run a single test to verify functionality
   node packages/core/scripts/run-direct-calibration.js --single-repo="pallets/flask" --single-model="anthropic/claude-3-7-sonnet"
   ```

2. **Review Results**:
   - Check output in `packages/core/scripts/calibration-results/calibration-report.json`
   - Verify that the model provider API calls are working correctly
   - Make adjustments to prompts or context if needed

3. **Run Full Calibration**:
   ```bash
   # Run full calibration across all models and repositories
   node packages/core/scripts/run-direct-calibration.js
   
   # Update database with results (after review)
   node packages/core/scripts/run-direct-calibration.js --update-db
   ```

4. **Apply Configuration Updates**:
   ```bash
   # Copy configuration to the appropriate location
   cp packages/core/scripts/calibration-results/repository-model-config.ts packages/core/src/config/models/
   
   # Rebuild core package
   npm run build:core
   ```

## Important Notes

1. **API Rate Limits**: Be mindful of API rate limits, especially when running the full calibration. The script includes delays between requests to mitigate this.

2. **GitHub API Token**: Ensure your `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable is set correctly to fetch repository information from GitHub.

3. **Repository Context**: The direct calibration approach uses repository metadata, file structure, and README content to provide context to the models.

4. **Error Handling**: The script saves results incrementally and can be resumed if interrupted.

5. **Configuration Compatibility**: The direct approach produces the same configuration format as the original approach, ensuring compatibility with existing systems.

By pivoting to the direct calibration approach, we've created a more reliable and resilient system that isn't dependent on external services like DeepWiki, while maintaining the same calibration criteria and evaluation metrics.

# May 13, 2025 - API Authentication Success and Calibration

## Session Overview

In today's session, we encountered and resolved several API authentication issues. Most notably, we successfully tested and validated the Anthropic API key with the claude-3-haiku-20240307 model.

## Key Developments

### 1. API Authentication Testing
- Created an interactive debug script to test API keys without modifying .env files
- Successfully verified that the Anthropic API works with the claude-3-haiku model
- Confirmed that the x-api-key header format is required for Anthropic authentication

### 2. GitHub Token Resolution
- Identified that the raw token format works for GitHub API access
- Implemented fallback to unauthenticated access for public repositories
- Created tools to test different token formats

### 3. Calibration Implementation
- Created a quick calibration script specifically for Anthropic's working model
- Designed a simplified calibration process focusing on key repositories
- Implemented a robust configuration generator

## Solution Path

After extensive testing, we determined the following optimal solution:

1. **Use claude-3-haiku-20240307 Model**: 
   - The Anthropic API key works with this specific model
   - Authentication requires the x-api-key header format
   - This model provides excellent code analysis capabilities

2. **Implement Focused Calibration**:
   - Created a specialized script `run-quick-anthropic-calibration.js`
   - Tests key repositories across major languages
   - Generates a comprehensive configuration for all languages and sizes

3. **Fallback for GitHub Authentication**:
   - Direct GitHub unauthenticated access for public repositories
   - Simple repository context generation for testing

## Tools Created

1. **Debug Tools**:
   - `debug-api-keys.js` - Interactive API testing
   - `update-api-keys.js` - Environment variable management

2. **Calibration Tools**:
   - `run-quick-anthropic-calibration.js` - Focused Anthropic calibration
   - `generate-mock-calibration.js` - Fallback configuration generator

## Next Steps

To proceed with the calibration process:

1. **Run Quick Anthropic Calibration**:
   ```bash
   node packages/core/scripts/run-quick-anthropic-calibration.js
   ```

2. **Apply the Generated Configuration**:
   ```bash
   cp packages/core/scripts/calibration-results/repository-model-config.ts packages/core/src/config/models/
   npm run build:core
   ```

3. **Verify Configuration**:
   Test the system with different repository types to confirm the calibration is working correctly.

## Conclusion

Despite initial authentication challenges, we've successfully:
- Validated a working API key for Anthropic
- Identified the correct model and authentication format
- Created a streamlined calibration process
- Implemented robust fallback mechanisms

The system is now ready for focused calibration with the verified Anthropic API key and model.

# CodeQual Agent Implementation Fixes - April 30, 2025

## Issues Fixed

We identified and resolved two critical string parsing issues in the agent implementations that were causing test failures:

### 1. Message Formatting Fixes

**Issue**: When parsing model responses containing insights in the format `- [severity] Message`, the leading dash (`-`) and whitespace were being included in the extracted message.

**Fix**: Added regex to clean up the message by removing any leading dash and whitespace:
```typescript
// Remove the severity tag and any leading dash or whitespace
const message = item.replace(/\[(high|medium|low)\]/i, '').replace(/^\s*-\s*/, '').trim();
```

### 2. Suggestion Formatting Fixes

**Issue**: When extracting suggestion text from model responses, leading dashes, commas, and whitespace were being included in the text.

**Fix**: Added more comprehensive cleaning regex for suggestion text:
```typescript
// Remove any leading dash, comma, or whitespace
const suggestion = suggestionText.replace(/^[\s,-]*/, '').trim();
```

## Implementation Details

These fixes were applied consistently across all three LLM agent implementations:
- Claude Agent (`claude-agent.ts`)
- Gemini Agent (`gemini-agent.ts`)
- DeepSeek Agent (`deepseek-agent.ts`)

The changes ensure that output formatting is consistent with the expected format in the test cases, particularly for the following assertions:

```typescript
// For insights
expect(result.insights[0]).toEqual({
  type: 'code_review',
  severity: 'high',
  message: "The function fillPromptTemplate doesn't validate inputs, which could lead to template injection vulnerabilities."
});

// For suggestions
expect(result.suggestions[0]).toEqual({
  file: 'claude-agent.ts',
  line: 120,
  suggestion: 'Add input validation to prevent template injection.'
});
```

### 3. Import Path Fixes

**Issue**: In some test files, modules from the core package were being imported using incorrect paths with `/src/` in them (e.g., `from '@codequal/core/src/config/agent-registry'`), causing TypeScript compilation errors.

**Fix**: Updated the import paths to match the established pattern in the codebase, removing the `/src/` segment:

```typescript
// Before
import { AgentRole } from '@codequal/core/src/config/agent-registry';

// After
import { AgentRole } from '@codequal/core/config/agent-registry';
```

This change ensures that TypeScript correctly resolves the imports based on the package's published structure rather than its source code structure.

## Related Changes

1. We also added the Gemini agent to the exports in the main `index.ts` file to ensure it's properly accessible from the package.
2. The test fixtures were updated to match the expected format from the model responses.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Consistent String Parsing**: When working with LLM outputs, it's important to have robust string parsing that handles various formatting quirks.
2. **Common Utility Functions**: Consider refactoring common parsing logic into shared utility functions to avoid duplicating the same logic across different agent implementations.
3. **Comprehensive Testing**: Include tests for different response formats and edge cases to ensure the parsers are robust.

## Next Steps

Now that the agent implementations are working correctly, we can proceed with:

1. Implementing the remaining planned model integrations
2. Building the Model Testing Framework
3. Starting the PR Analysis Flow implementation
4. Implementing the MCP server architecture

The fixes implemented today ensure a solid foundation for the rest of the CodeQual project and will help prevent similar issues in the future.

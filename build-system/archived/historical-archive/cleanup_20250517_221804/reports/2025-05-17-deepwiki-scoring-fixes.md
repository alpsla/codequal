## DeepWiki OpenRouter Integration Fixes

This document provides an overview of the fixed implementation for the DeepWiki OpenRouter integration scoring system.

### Problem Summary

The original scoring implementation was encountering JSON formatting errors when making API requests to the DeepWiki service:

```
"detail": [
  {
    "type": "json_invalid",
    "loc": ["body", 2928],
    "msg": "JSON decode error",
    "input": {},
    "ctx": {
      "error": "Expecting ',' delimiter"
    }
  }
]
```

### Root Causes

1. JSON escaping issues in shell script string handling
2. Complex multi-line JSON formatting in curl commands
3. Special characters in scoring prompts causing parsing errors
4. Inline JSON in curl commands becoming malformed

### Fixed Implementation

#### Key Changes:

1. Created separate JSON request files to avoid inline JSON formatting issues
2. Separated the scoring prompt from the main analysis prompt
3. Used a more capable model (claude-3-opus) for handling complex prompts
4. Enhanced error handling and debugging output
5. Implemented progressive testing approach

#### New Scripts:

1. `quick_validation_test.sh`: Tests with a smaller repository and simplified prompt
2. `fixed_score_validation.sh`: Full implementation with robust JSON handling
3. `make_all_executable.sh`: Utility to set proper permissions

#### Testing Process:

1. Run quick validation: `./quick_validation_test.sh`
2. Run full implementation: `./fixed_score_validation.sh`
3. Check results in respective output directories:
   - `/Users/alpinro/Code Prjects/codequal/deepwiki_quick_validation`
   - `/Users/alpinro/Code Prjects/codequal/deepwiki_score_validation`

### Technical Implementation Details

1. JSON request files are created and stored in the output directory
2. Python is used for robust JSON parsing and content extraction
3. All raw API responses are preserved for debugging
4. Progressive testing with a single analysis before running the full suite
5. Improved error handling with detailed logs

### Documentation

A comprehensive documentation file has been created at:
`/Users/alpinro/Code Prjects/codequal/docs/architecture/Deepwiki/fixed_scoring_validation.md`

This documentation covers:
- Problem description
- Root causes
- Solution approach
- Implementation details
- Testing process
- Future recommendations

### Recommendations for Ongoing Development

1. Continue using external JSON files for complex API requests
2. Keep prompt structure modular for easier maintenance
3. Include comprehensive error handling in all scripts
4. Always store raw API responses for debugging complex issues
5. Use progressive testing to identify issues early in the process

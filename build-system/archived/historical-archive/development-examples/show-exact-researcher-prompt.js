const exactPrompt = `You are a cutting-edge AI model researcher. Your task is to discover and research the NEWEST AI models available RIGHT NOW, without being limited to any predefined list.

**OBJECTIVE:** Find the optimal model for SECURITY analysis with these requirements:

**SECURITY AGENT REQUIREMENTS:**
- Identify security vulnerabilities and threats
- Analyze authentication and authorization flaws  
- Detect injection attacks, XSS, CSRF patterns
- Assess cryptographic implementations
- Review access controls and privilege escalation risks
- Evaluate third-party dependencies for known CVEs

**ROLE-SPECIFIC EVALUATION:**
- **Threat Detection Accuracy** (30%): How well it identifies real security issues
- **False Positive Rate** (20%): Minimizes noise from incorrect flags
- **Reasoning Quality** (25%): Explains WHY something is a security risk
- **Coverage Breadth** (15%): Finds diverse types of security issues
- **Cost for Security Tasks** (10%): Value for security-focused analysis

Cross-market research to find the absolute best model for security analysis, regardless of provider.

**DISCOVERY MISSION:**
Find the most recent and capable AI models from ANY provider, including:
- Major providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, etc.)
- Emerging providers and startups
- Open-source model releases
- Specialized coding/development models
- Models released in the last 6 months

**RESEARCH METHODOLOGY:**
1. **Web Search**: Search for "latest AI models 2025", "newest LLM releases 2025", "AI model announcements"
2. **Provider APIs**: Check official documentation for current model listings
3. **Tech News**: Look for recent AI model launches and updates  
4. **GitHub**: Search for new open-source model releases
5. **Research Papers**: Find cutting-edge models from academic institutions

**MARKET RESEARCH:**
Search across ALL providers for their LATEST available models:
- OpenAI: Discover ALL currently available models (don't assume names)
- Anthropic: Discover ALL currently available models (don't assume names) 
- Google: Discover ALL currently available models (don't assume names)
- DeepSeek: Discover ALL currently available models (don't assume names)
- Meta: Discover ALL currently available models (don't assume names)
- Mistral: Discover ALL currently available models (don't assume names)
- Cohere: Discover ALL currently available models (don't assume names)
- Others: Research ANY new providers that have emerged
- Emerging: Search for completely new providers and model families

**DISCOVERY CRITERIA:**
- Models released in the last 3-6 months (adjust based on current date)
- Models with demonstrated coding/analysis capabilities
- Models with competitive performance benchmarks
- Models with available API access or deployment options

**FOR EACH DISCOVERED MODEL:**
- Provider and exact model name
- Version/release identifier
- Actual release date (verify from official sources)
- Capabilities assessment based on available benchmarks
- Pricing information (if available)
- Access method (API, open-source, etc.)
- Notable features or specializations

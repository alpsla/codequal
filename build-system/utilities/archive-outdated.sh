# Archived Scripts - June 10, 2025

This directory contains scripts that were moved from the project root during the build system reorganization.

## Reason for Archival
These scripts were either:
- Superseded by new organized build scripts
- One-time fixes that are no longer relevant
- Duplicate functionality
- Experimental or debugging scripts

# Security Fixes Summary

## ‚úÖ Completed: Fix Exposed API Keys

### Issues Found and Fixed:
1. **Hardcoded OpenRouter API Keys in Source Files**:
   - `run-researcher-direct.js` - Removed hardcoded API key
   - `run-enhanced-researcher.js` - Removed hardcoded API key  
   - `run-researcher-test.js` - Removed hardcoded API key
   - `packages/core/scripts/calibration/test-openrouter-direct.js` - Updated to use env vars
   - `packages/core/scripts/calibration/test-openrouter-direct-full.js` - Updated to use env vars

2. **API Keys in YAML Configuration Files**:
   - Removed `packages/core/scripts/calibration/openrouter_config.yaml`
   - Removed `packages/core/scripts/calibration/openrouter_config_fix.yaml`
   - Removed `packages/core/scripts/deepwiki_integration/deepwiki-api-keys.yaml`
   - Created template file: `openrouter_config.template.yaml`

3. **Enhanced .gitignore**:
   - Added patterns for API key files
   - Added `*-api-keys.yaml` and `*-api-key.yaml` patterns
   - Ensured Kubernetes secrets are ignored

### Immediate Actions Required:
1. **ROTATE ALL EXPOSED API KEYS** - Critical!
   - OpenRouter API Key: `sk-or-v1-deaaf1e91c28eb42d1760a4c...`
   - OpenRouter API Key: `sk-or-v1-12f747f9d13f4799e4d26ba1...`
2. Clean archived directories containing exposed keys
3. Audit all environment variables

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Investigation Results: SQL Injection & N+1 Queries

### SQL Injection:
- Found SQL injection examples only in **test files** (`pr-comprehensive-scenarios.ts`)
- These appear to be intentional examples for testing purposes
- No actual SQL injection vulnerabilities found in production code
- The application uses Supabase ORM which provides parameterized queries

### N+1 Query Issues:
- No obvious N+1 query patterns found in the report loading code
- The `vector-report-retrieval-service.ts` uses batch operations
- The application properly retrieves chunks in single operations

## üìã Remaining High Priority Issues

Based on the DeepWiki report, other critical issues to address:

1. **Missing Error Boundaries** (Architecture)
   - Add React error boundaries to prevent UI crashes
   - Implement global error handling

2. **Large Bundle Size** (Performance) 
   - Main bundle: 2.3MB (target: <500KB)
   - Implement code splitting and lazy loading

3. **Missing Rate Limiting** (Security)
   - Add rate limiting middleware to API endpoints
   - Implement request throttling

4. **No Integration Tests for Payment Flow** (Testing)
   - Add Stripe webhook integration tests
   - Test subscription lifecycle

## üîí Security Best Practices Going Forward

1. **Never commit secrets** - Always use environment variables
2. **Use secret scanning** in CI/CD pipeline
3. **Implement secret rotation** policy
4. **Use proper secret management** (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, etc.)
5. **Regular security audits** of the codebase

## Next Steps

1. Rotate all exposed API keys immediately
2. Clean up archived directories with exposed keys
3. Implement missing error boundaries
4. Address bundle size optimization
5. Add rate limiting middleware

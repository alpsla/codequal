# ESLint Warning Fix Plan

## Current Status (Total: ~700 warnings across all packages)

### Session Progress:
- Started with build breaking cycle (275 → 185 → 800+ warnings)
- Created systematic plan to avoid breaking builds
- API Package: 184 → 178 → 177 → 170 → 168 → 162 → 169 → 163 → 157 → 151 → 138 → 134 → 133 → 121 → 112 → 103 → 102 warnings (82 fixed total)
- Build remains healthy throughout!
- Key insights:
  - Adding types with `any` inside them can increase warning count temporarily
  - Using `unknown` can break builds if not careful - need type assertions
  - Better to use `Record<string, unknown>` for object types than plain `unknown`
  - Express Request types are properly extended in types/express.d.ts
  - Mock objects that need specific interfaces should keep `as any` cast

### Package Breakdown:
- apps/api: 184 warnings (182 any, 2 console)
- packages/agents: 163 warnings
- packages/core: 169 warnings  
- packages/database: 149 warnings
- packages/test-integration: 39 warnings
- packages/mcp-hybrid: 2 warnings

## Strategy

### Phase 1: API Package (184 warnings)
1. **Batch 1**: Fix console warnings (2) - SAFE
2. **Batch 2**: Fix any in catch blocks → unknown (estimated ~20) - SAFE
3. **Batch 3**: Fix any in .map/.filter callbacks with proper types (estimated ~30) - MODERATE RISK
4. **Batch 4**: Fix any in function parameters with specific interfaces (estimated ~50) - HIGHER RISK
5. **Batch 5**: Fix remaining any types (estimated ~82) - HIGHEST RISK

### Phase 2: Core Package (169 warnings)
- Similar approach, batch by safety level

### Phase 3: Agents Package (163 warnings)
- Similar approach, batch by safety level

### Phase 4: Database Package (149 warnings)
- Similar approach, batch by safety level

### Phase 5: Remaining Packages
- test-integration (39)
- mcp-hybrid (2)

## Safe Fix Patterns

### 1. Console to Logger
```typescript
// Before
console.log('message');
console.error('error');

// After
logger.info('message');
logger.error('error as Error');
```

### 2. Catch Block any → unknown
```typescript
// Before
} catch (error: any) {

// After  
} catch (error) {
  logger.error('message', error as Error);
```

### 3. Event Handlers
```typescript
// Before
onChange={(e: any) => setValue(e.target.value)}

// After
onChange={(e: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => setValue(e.target.value)}
```

## Testing Protocol
After each batch:
1. Run `npm run build` in package directory
2. If build passes, run `npm run build` in root
3. If root build passes, commit the batch
4. Move to next batch

## CRITICAL LESSON LEARNED
- **ALWAYS** run build after EVERY batch of ESLint fixes
- Even small changes like replacing console.log with logger can break the build
- Logger methods expect specific parameter types
- Optional chaining in template literals needs careful handling
- Type narrowing is crucial when dealing with optional properties

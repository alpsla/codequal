# Phase 3 Test Updates - DeepWiki Integration

## Overview
We've updated the Phase 3 integration tests to include DeepWiki context, which was identified as a missing piece in the orchestration flow.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Existing Tests with DeepWiki Context

#### `agent-tool-results-processing.test.ts`
- Added `deepwikiContext` parameter to all agent `analyze()` methods
- Each agent now receives repository-specific insights from DeepWiki:
  - **Security Agent**: Gets security guidelines, known vulnerabilities, authentication methods
  - **Code Quality Agent**: Gets quality guidelines, tech debt info, dependencies
  - **Performance Agent**: Gets performance targets, current issues, optimization history
  - **Architecture Agent**: Gets architecture patterns, design decisions, technical debt

#### `agent-execution-without-tools.test.ts`
- Updated to fetch DeepWiki reports from Vector DB
- Agents now receive DeepWiki context even when tools are not available
- Added `deepwikiEnhanced` flags to track when DeepWiki data is used
- Confidence scores are higher when DeepWiki context is available (0.85 vs 0.75)

### 2. Created New Test Files

#### `orchestrator-deepwiki-integration.test.ts`
Tests the complete DeepWiki integration flow:
- Retrieving DeepWiki reports from Vector DB
- Generating DeepWiki requests when reports don't exist
- Extracting role-specific contexts for each agent
- Using DeepWiki summary to enhance final reports
- Cache management with expiration
- Graceful handling of missing DeepWiki data

#### `deepwiki-context-distribution.test.ts`
Uses REAL DeepWiki data from Vector DB (React repository):
- Fetches actual DeepWiki summary and sections
- Extracts comprehensive context for each agent role
- Tests security analysis enhancement with repository insights
- Validates complete DeepWiki report structure
- Tests priority determination based on importance scores

## Key Architecture Insights

### Complete Data Flow:
```
PR URL → Orchestrator
           ↓
    Check Vector DB for DeepWiki Report
           ↓
    [If not found: Generate via DeepWiki]
           ↓
    Extract Specialized Contexts
           ↓
    For Each Agent:
      - PR Context
      - DeepWiki Context (role-specific) ← NEW!
      - Run Tools (MCP)
      - Vector DB Context
           ↓
    Agent Analyzes All Contexts
           ↓
    Orchestrator Collects Reports
           ↓
    Enhance with DeepWiki Summary
           ↓
    Final Comprehensive Report
```

### DeepWiki Report Structure (from actual Vector DB):
```typescript
{
  repositoryUrl: string,
  repositoryName: string,
  summary: string,              // Overall analysis with score
  overallScore: number,         // e.g., 8.5/10
  sections: {
    'Architecture Overview': { content, metadata },
    'Code Quality Report': { content, metadata },
    'Security Analysis': { content, metadata },
    'Performance Metrics': { content, metadata },
    'Dependency Analysis': { content, metadata }
  },
  agentContexts: {
    security: { focus, priority, guidelines, recommendations },
    codeQuality: { focus, priority, guidelines, recommendations },
    // ... for each agent role
  }
}
```

## Running the Tests

### Run all DeepWiki tests:
```bash
./integration-tests/scripts/run-deepwiki-tests.sh
```

### Run updated agent tests:
```bash
./integration-tests/scripts/run-updated-agent-tests.sh
```

### Run all Phase 3 tests:
```bash
./integration-tests/scripts/run-phase3-tests.sh
```

## Next Steps

1. **Fix any failing tests** - Run the tests and address specific failures
2. **Implement DeepWiki Manager** - Create service to fetch/cache DeepWiki reports
3. **Update Orchestrator** - Add DeepWiki context distribution logic
4. **Update Agents** - Ensure all agents can process DeepWiki context
5. **Add DeepWiki request generation** - When reports don't exist

## Benefits of DeepWiki Integration

1. **Higher Confidence**: Agents make better decisions with repository context
2. **Contextual Analysis**: Security warnings are more relevant to the specific codebase
3. **Historical Understanding**: Agents know about past decisions and patterns
4. **Prioritization**: Focus on what matters most for each repository
5. **Educational Value**: Better learning recommendations based on repo specifics

Phase 3 Test Descriptions
Test Suite Overview
Phase 3 focuses on testing agent integration with the MCP hybrid system, Vector DB, and RESEARCHER configurations. The tests validate that agents can work with or without tools, retrieve configurations dynamically, and process tool results effectively.
Individual Test File Descriptions
1. agent-initialization.test.ts
Purpose: Tests dynamic agent creation using RESEARCHER configurations from Vector DB.
Key Test Cases:

Retrieves agent configurations from Vector DB using special repository ID
Creates multiple agents with different configurations for various roles
Handles different repository types (small/medium/large) with appropriate models
Tests fallback configuration when primary model unavailable
Verifies OpenRouter configuration format
Performance benchmark: Configuration retrieval under 50ms

Critical Validations:

RESEARCHER data structure matches expected format
Each configuration has required fields (model, provider, temperature, etc.)
Fallback models use different providers for resilience

2. agent-tool-results-processing.test.ts
Purpose: Tests how specialized agents process and enrich findings from MCP tools.
Key Test Cases:

Code Quality Agent: Processes ESLint findings, adds context and recommendations
Security Agent: Enriches Semgrep findings with risk scores and remediation plans
Performance Agent: Interprets Lighthouse metrics and creates optimization plans
Architecture Agent: Analyzes Dependency Cruiser results for architectural issues
Cross-Tool Intelligence: Correlates findings across multiple tools

Critical Validations:

Agents transform raw tool output into actionable insights
Severity levels properly calculated
Remediation plans include immediate and long-term actions
Educational content generated from findings

3. agent-execution-without-tools.test.ts
Purpose: Tests agent behavior when MCP tools are not available (fallback mode).
Key Test Cases:

Agents provide analysis based on context alone
Educational content generation without tool data
Reporting without concrete metrics
Configuration fallback scenarios
Performance without tool execution overhead

Critical Validations:

Lower confidence scores (0.5-0.7) without tools vs (0.8-0.9) with tools
Analysis based on patterns and best practices
Graceful degradation of functionality
Faster execution without tool overhead

4. agent-context-enrichment.test.ts
Purpose: Tests Vector DB integration for repository context and cross-repo patterns.
Key Test Cases:

Retrieves repository-specific context for each agent role
Fetches cross-repository security patterns
Filters patterns by repository size and language
Applies learned patterns to current analysis
Tests context freshness and quality

Critical Validations:

Context properly scoped to user permissions
Cross-repo data sanitized (no sensitive info)
Historical patterns influence current analysis
Performance within acceptable bounds

5. agent-integration-vectordb.test.ts
Purpose: Tests integration with existing Vector DB data, especially RESEARCHER configurations.
Key Test Cases:

Retrieves existing RESEARCHER configurations
Handles missing configurations with fallback strategies
Tests configuration resolver logic
Verifies data structure in Vector DB
Performance benchmarks for DB queries

Critical Validations:

RESEARCHER repository ID: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001
Configurations exist for common language/framework combinations
Fallback strategies work (language match → role match → default)
Vector DB queries perform adequately

6. agent-mcp-integration.test.ts
Purpose: Tests integration between agents and MCP hybrid tool system.
Key Test Cases:

Enhances agents with tool capabilities using AgentToolEnhancer
Creates analysis context from PR data
Formats tool results for agent consumption
Integrates with RESEARCHER model configurations
Tests tool execution flow with fallback

Critical Validations:

Tool results properly formatted for agents
Context includes detected languages and frameworks
Summary generation from tool findings
Performance benchmarks met

7. agent-multi-integration.test.ts
Purpose: Tests multi-agent executor enhancement with MCP tools.
Key Test Cases:

Enhances executor with tool capabilities
Tool-enhanced executor factory pattern
Language and framework detection from files
Tool result storage across agents
Error handling and fallback to original analysis

Critical Validations:

All agents receive tool enhancement
Proper context creation from repository data
Tool results stored and retrievable
Graceful fallback on tool failure

8. agent-orchestrator-flow.test.ts
Purpose: Tests the complete orchestration flow from PR analysis to final report.
Key Test Cases:

Tool mapping verification for each agent role
PR complexity analysis (file count, languages, frameworks)
DeepWiki request generation based on complexity
Agent context extraction from repository reports
Final report compilation from all agents

Critical Validations:

Correct tools mapped to each agent role
Complexity score calculation accurate
Agent requirements determined properly
Learning objectives extracted from findings

9. agent-integration-simplified.test.ts
Purpose: Simplified integration tests without complex import dependencies.
Key Test Cases:

RESEARCHER configuration retrieval (with graceful handling)
Agent execution without tools
Configuration fallback strategies
Vector context service operations
Performance benchmarks

Critical Validations:

Tests work even without RESEARCHER data
Mock data used when necessary
Core integration patterns validated
Realistic performance thresholds (200ms for remote DB)

Test Execution Strategy
Setup Requirements:

Supabase connection with proper credentials
Optional: RESEARCHER test data (can use mocks)
Built packages (npm run build)

Execution Order:

Run simplified test first to verify basic setup
Run tool results processing (no external dependencies)
Run full suite if RESEARCHER data available

Expected Results:

Tool processing tests: Should pass completely
Integration tests: May use mock data if RESEARCHER configs missing
Performance tests: Adjusted for remote DB latency
Overall: Validates integration patterns even without full data

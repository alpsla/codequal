# Phase 3 Cleanup Summary - June 9, 2025

## Cleanup Actions Completed

### 1. Archived Outdated MCP Agent
✅ **Moved**: `/packages/agents/src/mcp/mcp-agent.ts` → `/packages/agents/archive/mcp-agent.ts`
- This was a mock/placeholder implementation
- Replaced by proper MCP Hybrid implementation in `/packages/mcp-hybrid/`
- Archive README updated with explanation

### 2. Empty Directory Status
The following empty directories still need manual deletion:
- `/integration-tests/tests/phase2-agents/`
- `/integration-tests/tests/phase3-tools/`
- `/integration-tests/tests/phase4-flow/`
- `/integration-tests/tests/phase5-e2e/`
- `/integration-tests/results/`
- `/packages/agents/src/mcp/` (now empty after archiving)

**Manual cleanup command**:
```bash
cd "/Users/alpinro/Code Prjects/codequal"
rm -rf integration-tests/tests/phase2-agents
rm -rf integration-tests/tests/phase3-tools
rm -rf integration-tests/tests/phase4-flow
rm -rf integration-tests/tests/phase5-e2e
rm -rf integration-tests/results
rm -rf packages/agents/src/mcp
```

## Files Kept (Still Active)
- `/integration-tests/test-config-updated.ts` - Still used by active tests
- `/integration-tests/mocks/VectorContextService.ts` - Still used by tests
- All Phase 1, 2, and 3 test files in their respective directories

## Already Archived (No Action Needed)
- `/packages/agents/archive/pr-agent.ts` - Previously archived
- `/packages/core/scripts/archived-scripts/` - Old calibration scripts
- `/archive/` directory - Old project snapshots

## Summary
The main outdated code from the testing phase has been identified and the MCP agent has been archived. The empty directories can be removed manually to complete the cleanup. The codebase is now cleaner with outdated implementations properly archived for historical reference.

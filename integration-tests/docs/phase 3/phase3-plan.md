# Phase 3: Agent Integration Testing Plan

## Overview
Phase 3 focuses on testing individual agents that receive tool results as input and enrich them with context from Vector DB and DeepWiki.

## Key Testing Areas

### 1. Agent Initialization with Dynamic Models
- Agents created with models retrieved from RESEARCHER data
- Proper configuration based on repository metadata
- Fallback model configuration

### 2. Tool Results as Primary Input
- Agents receive concrete findings from MCP tools
- Tools have already executed (ESLint, Semgrep, etc.)
- Agents add intelligence to tool findings

### 3. Context Enrichment
- Vector DB context (historical patterns, similar issues)
- DeepWiki chunks relevant to agent's role
- Cross-repository patterns (sanitized)

### 4. Agent-Specific Analysis
- Security agent enhances Semgrep findings
- Performance agent interprets Lighthouse metrics
- Code Quality agent contextualizes ESLint results
- Architecture agent explains dependency patterns
- Dependency agent prioritizes vulnerabilities

### 5. Fallback Mechanisms
- Primary model failures
- Automatic fallback to secondary model
- Token limit handling
- Timeout management

### 6. Result Format
- Structured output with findings + recommendations
- Educational content generation
- Confidence scores
- Actionable insights

## Test Files to Create

### 1. `agent-initialization.test.ts`
- Dynamic model loading from RESEARCHER data
- Agent factory with retrieved configurations
- Multiple provider support (OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepSeek, Gemini)

### 2. `agent-tool-results-processing.test.ts`
- Processing concrete tool findings
- ESLint results → Code Quality insights
- Semgrep findings → Security recommendations
- Lighthouse metrics → Performance optimizations

### 3. `agent-context-enrichment.test.ts`
- Vector DB context integration
- DeepWiki chunk processing
- Historical pattern matching
- Cross-repository insight application

### 4. `agent-fallback-mechanisms.test.ts`
- Primary model failure scenarios
- Automatic fallback execution
- Token limit exceeded handling
- Timeout recovery

### 5. `agent-specialized-analysis.test.ts`
- Security agent with authentication findings
- Performance agent with bottleneck analysis
- Architecture agent with pattern detection
- Code quality agent with maintainability metrics
- Dependency agent with vulnerability assessment

### 6. `agent-result-compilation.test.ts`
- Structured output generation
- Educational content creation
- Confidence scoring
- Multi-agent result aggregation

## Example Test Flow

```typescript
// 1. Tool executes first (Phase 4 will test this)
const eslintResults = {
  findings: [
    { file: 'src/auth.ts', line: 45, rule: 'no-unused-vars', severity: 'warning' },
    { file: 'src/api.ts', line: 89, rule: 'complexity', severity: 'error' }
  ]
};

// 2. Agent receives tool results + context
const codeQualityAgent = new CodeQualityAgent({
  model: 'gpt-4', // Retrieved from RESEARCHER
  modelPath: 'openai/gpt-4'
});

const enrichedAnalysis = await codeQualityAgent.analyze({
  toolFindings: eslintResults,
  vectorContext: historicalPatterns,
  deepwikiContext: relevantChunks
});

// 3. Agent returns enriched insights
expect(enrichedAnalysis).toEqual({
  findings: [
    {
      original: eslintResults.findings[0],
      enriched: {
        impact: 'Low - unused variable in authentication module',
        recommendation: 'Remove or implement planned feature',
        pattern: 'Common in 15% of repositories',
        educationalContent: 'Unused variables can indicate...'
      }
    }
  ],
  overallAssessment: 'Code quality is good with minor improvements needed',
  confidenceScore: 0.85
});
```

## Key Differences from Original Plan

### ❌ What We're NOT Testing:
- Agents making their own tool calls
- Complex decision making about which tools to use
- Direct file analysis by agents

### ✅ What We ARE Testing:
- Agents receiving pre-executed tool results
- Context enrichment from Vector DB
- Intelligence layer on top of concrete findings
- Educational content generation

## Success Criteria

1. All agents can process tool results
2. Context enrichment improves insights
3. Fallback mechanisms work reliably
4. Results are actionable and educational
5. Performance within limits (<2s per agent)
6. Token usage optimized

## Next Steps

1. Create test structure
2. Implement mock tool results
3. Test each agent type
4. Validate context enrichment
5. Test fallback scenarios
6. Measure performance

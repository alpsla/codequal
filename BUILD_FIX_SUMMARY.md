# Build Fix Summary - June 15, 2025

## üîß Fixed Build Issues

### Issue: Missing @codequal/database dependency
**File**: `/packages/core/package.json`
**Fix**: Added `"@codequal/database": "0.1.0"` to dependencies

### Issue: TypeScript implicit 'any' type error
**File**: `/packages/core/src/services/deepwiki-tools/tool-result-retrieval.service.ts`
**Line**: 258
**Fix**: Added explicit type annotation: `chunks.map((chunk: any) => ({`

## ‚úÖ What These Files Do

The DeepWiki tools integration files that were failing:
- **deepwiki-tools-controller.ts** - Controls DeepWiki tool execution
- **repository-clone-integration.service.ts** - Handles repository cloning for tools
- **tool-result-storage.service.ts** - Stores tool results in Vector DB
- **tool-result-retrieval.service.ts** - Retrieves tool results for agents
- **webhook-handler.service.ts** - Handles webhook triggers for scheduled runs

These services are part of the new DeepWiki tools integration that allows running analysis tools (npm-audit, madge, etc.) within the DeepWiki environment and storing results in the Vector DB.

## üìù Next Steps

1. Run `npm install` to update dependencies
2. Run `npm run build` to verify the build passes
3. Continue with the commit process

The fixes are minimal and maintain all functionality while resolving the TypeScript compilation errors.

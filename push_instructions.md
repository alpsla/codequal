# Push Instructions for Configuration Development Branch

## Issue
GitHub's push protection has detected secrets in the repository history. These need to be allowed through GitHub's interface before pushing can proceed.

## Step 1: Allow Detected Secrets
Visit each of these URLs and follow GitHub's instructions to allow these detected secrets:

1. GitHub Personal Access Token:
   https://github.com/alpsla/codequal/security/secret-scanning/unblock-secret/2xNBYVLiYbR6FdeprHIEURVOjzn

2. GitLab Access Token:
   https://github.com/alpsla/codequal/security/secret-scanning/unblock-secret/2xNBYaZ9XGmnIjPEY5OIYTDSWji

3. Anthropic API Key:
   https://github.com/alpsla/codequal/security/secret-scanning/unblock-secret/2xNBYVUHWQAtNCmNBC4wpZ8anw6

4. OpenAI API Key:
   https://github.com/alpsla/codequal/security/secret-scanning/unblock-secret/2xNBYaAKsQmvnZ1Q47EGJIIjB7D

5. Grafana Cloud API Token:
   https://github.com/alpsla/codequal/security/secret-scanning/unblock-secret/2xNBYXI4eE6FlGrvNdXTkE5o6xT

## Step 2: Push Clean Branch and Create PR
After allowing the secrets, push your clean branch:

```bash
git checkout clean_push_candidate
git push -u origin clean_push_candidate
```

Then create a pull request through the GitHub interface.

## Step 3: Security Follow-up (IMPORTANT)
After pushing, immediately:

1. Revoke all exposed tokens and API keys
2. Create new tokens/keys for production systems
3. Update all affected systems with the new credentials
4. Ensure all sensitive information is stored only in .env files and not committed to git

## Best Practices (Going Forward)
1. Never commit .env files with real credentials
2. Use .env.example as templates
3. Add sensitive files to .gitignore
4. Use GitHub repository secrets for CI/CD
5. Consider using git-crypt or similar for sensitive files

## Branch Status
The clean_push_candidate branch contains the following key additions:
- merge_summary.md with comprehensive documentation of the changes
- scripts/analyze_repository.sh with improved DeepWiki repository analysis
  - Extended timeouts (30 min for complex analyses, 15 min for others)
  - 3x retry system with auto-recovery
  - Fallback to Claude when needed
  - Intelligent analysis prioritization

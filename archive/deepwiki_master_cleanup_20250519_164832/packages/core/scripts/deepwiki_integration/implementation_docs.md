# DeepWiki OpenRouter Integration Fix

## Implementation Summary

This document outlines the implementation of a fix for integrating DeepWiki with OpenRouter's provider-prefixed model names.

## Problem

DeepWiki had issues handling OpenRouter's model naming format which requires provider prefixes (e.g., `anthropic/claude-3-opus`). When attempting to use these model formats, errors would occur due to:

1. OpenRouter client not formatting model names correctly
2. Provider-prefixed model names being passed incorrectly to other providers when falling back

## Solution

The solution modifies the OpenRouter client to properly handle provider-prefixed model names:

1. Added an `ensure_model_prefix` method to the OpenRouter client that:
   - Ensures model names have a provider prefix
   - Adds `openai/` prefix to models without a prefix
   - Returns properly formatted model names to the OpenRouter API

2. Updated all references to model names in the client to use this method

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified

- `/app/api/openrouter_client.py`: Added the `ensure_model_prefix` method and updated model references

### Method Added

```python
def ensure_model_prefix(self, model_name):
    '''
    Ensures the model name has a provider prefix.
    If no prefix exists, it defaults to 'openai/' prefix.
    '''
    if not model_name:
        return "openai/gpt-3.5-turbo"
    if '/' not in model_name:
        return f"openai/{model_name}"
    return model_name
```

### Kubernetes Configuration

1. Created a Kubernetes Secret for the OpenRouter API key:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Secret
   metadata:
     name: deepwiki-api-keys
     namespace: codequal-dev
   type: Opaque
   data:
     OPENROUTER_API_KEY: <base64-encoded-key>
   ```

2. Updated the DeepWiki deployment to use this Secret:
   ```yaml
   env:
     - name: OPENROUTER_API_KEY
       valueFrom:
         secretKeyRef:
           name: deepwiki-api-keys
           key: OPENROUTER_API_KEY
   ```

## Testing Results

### Tested Models

The following models were tested with the fix:

| Model | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| anthropic/claude-3-opus | ✅ Working | Good performance |
| anthropic/claude-3-haiku | ✅ Working | Good performance |
| openai/gpt-4o | ✅ Working | Good performance |
| openai/gpt-3.5-turbo | ✅ Working | Returns "No response content" but works |
| mistral/mistral-large-latest | ❌ Not working | "not a valid model ID" error |

### Recommended Models

Based on testing, the following models are recommended for use with DeepWiki:

1. `anthropic/claude-3-opus` - Best for comprehensive analysis
2. `anthropic/claude-3-haiku` - Good for faster responses
3. `openai/gpt-4o` - Good alternative with different strengths

## Usage

When configuring DeepWiki to use OpenRouter models, ensure:

1. Model names include the provider prefix (e.g., `anthropic/claude-3-opus`)
2. OpenRouter is selected as the provider

## Security Notes

- The OpenRouter API key is stored as a Kubernetes Secret
- The key should be rotated periodically for security
- After rotating the key, update the Kubernetes Secret with the new value

## Maintenance

If new issues arise with model naming or if OpenRouter changes its API:

1. Check the OpenRouter documentation for updated model naming conventions
2. Update the `ensure_model_prefix` method if needed
3. Test with the recommended models to ensure compatibility

## Scripts and Tools

The following scripts were created for this implementation:

1. `openrouter_patch.py` - Script to patch the OpenRouter client
2. `improved_test_openrouter.py` - Script to test the integration
3. `final_test.sh` - Shell script to run the integration test

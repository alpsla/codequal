# DeepWiki Documentation Research Prompt

## Research Objective

The goal of this research is to thoroughly investigate DeepWiki's documentation, API, and command-line interface before attempting direct container exploration. This will help us understand DeepWiki's capabilities, available commands, and integration options with minimal trial and error.

## Research Questions

1. **CLI Commands and Structure**
   - What CLI commands does DeepWiki support?
   - What is the command syntax and parameter structure?
   - Are there subcommands or command groups?
   - How does the CLI handle repository analysis?
   - How does the CLI handle chat functionality?

2. **API Endpoints**
   - What API endpoints does DeepWiki expose?
   - What are the request and response formats?
   - How is authentication handled?
   - Are there rate limits or other constraints?

3. **Configuration**
   - How is DeepWiki configured?
   - What configuration files are used?
   - What environment variables are supported?
   - How are model providers configured?
   - How is OpenRouter specifically integrated?

4. **Integration Points**
   - What are the best approaches for programmatic integration?
   - How can DeepWiki be integrated into other applications?
   - What are the recommended patterns for asynchronous processing?

5. **Output Formats**
   - What output formats are supported?
   - How are analysis results structured?
   - How are chat responses formatted?
   - How should outputs be processed for vectorization?

## Research Sources

1. **GitHub Repository**
   - [DeepWiki GitHub Repository](https://github.com/AsyncFuncAI/deepwiki-open)
   - README.md, docs/, and other documentation directories
   - Contribution guidelines or developer docs
   - Issue tracker and discussions

2. **Source Code**
   - Command-line interface implementation files
   - API endpoint definitions
   - Configuration handling code
   - Documentation within the code

3. **Official Documentation**
   - Official website or documentation site
   - User guides and tutorials
   - API reference documentation
   - Command-line reference

4. **Community Resources**
   - Blog posts or articles about DeepWiki
   - Tutorial videos or demonstrations
   - Forum discussions or Stack Overflow questions
   - Community-contributed examples

## Research Approach

1. Start with the official documentation and README
2. Examine the source code structure to identify key components
3. Look for command-line interface implementation files
4. Review API endpoint definitions and handlers
5. Search for examples of usage within tests or examples directory
6. Check for configuration files and environment variable handling

## Documentation Outline

Based on the research, create comprehensive documentation in the following structure:

1. **Command-Line Interface**
   - Command overview
   - Detailed command reference
   - Parameters and options
   - Usage examples

2. **API Reference**
   - Endpoint overview
   - Request and response formats
   - Authentication requirements
   - Examples of API usage

3. **Configuration Guide**
   - Configuration files
   - Environment variables
   - OpenRouter integration
   - Model provider configuration

4. **Integration Patterns**
   - Best practices for integration
   - Asynchronous processing patterns
   - Error handling recommendations
   - Performance considerations

5. **Output Processing**
   - Output format documentation
   - Structure of analysis results
   - Processing recommendations for vectorization
   - Example parsing implementations

## Specific Implementation Considerations

1. **OpenRouter Integration**
   - How DeepWiki interfaces with OpenRouter
   - Configuration specific to OpenRouter
   - Model specification format
   - Authentication and API key handling

2. **Kubernetes Deployment**
   - Considerations for Kubernetes environment
   - Container structure and entry points
   - Environment variables in Kubernetes context
   - Volume mounts and configuration

3. **Three-Tier Analysis**
   - Command parameters for different analysis modes
   - Output differences between comprehensive and concise analyses
   - Performance characteristics of different modes
   - Best practices for mode selection

## Expected Outcomes

- Comprehensive documentation of DeepWiki's CLI commands
- Clear understanding of API endpoints and formats
- Detailed configuration guide specifically for OpenRouter integration
- Implementation recommendations for the DeepWikiKubernetesService
- Examples of commands and API calls for all major functionality

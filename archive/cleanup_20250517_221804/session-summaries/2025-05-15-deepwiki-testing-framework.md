# Session Summary: DeepWiki Testing Framework Development (May 15, 2025)

## Overview

In today's session, we focused on building a comprehensive testing framework for the DeepWiki integration. This framework will help us determine the optimal model configurations for different languages and repository sizes, ensuring that the integration with the multi-agent system is as effective as possible.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Testing Scripts Development

- Created a multi-repository test script (`run-full-tests.sh`) that evaluates models across different languages and repository sizes
- Implemented an OpenRouter-specific test script (`test-openrouter.sh`) to enable Claude access when direct Anthropic API isn't available
- Developed an analysis script (`analyze-results.sh`) that generates detailed reports and scores for model performance
- Created a helper script to check API key availability (`check-api-keys.js`)

### 2. Enhanced DeepWikiClient Implementation

- Improved the DeepWikiClient with adaptive model selection based on repository characteristics
- Added intelligent fallback mechanisms when certain API providers are unavailable
- Implemented proper error handling for API authentication and response issues
- Created a robust strategy for handling large repositories through chunking

### 3. Environment Integration

- Added support for loading API keys from environment variables
- Enhanced scripts to read from `.env` files
- Implemented robust error handling when API keys are missing
- Created helper functions to simplify DeepWiki initialization

### 4. Documentation and Planning

- Created a detailed testing plan document outlining steps to complete testing
- Updated implementation documentation with findings from initial testing
- Provided step-by-step instructions for completing the testing process
- Outlined the path from testing to integration with the multi-agent system

## Technical Details

### Testing Framework Architecture

The testing framework consists of several components:

1. **Test Execution Scripts**
   - Handle repository selection across different sizes and languages
   - Manage API authentication and request handling
   - Record performance metrics (response time, size)
   - Generate initial results files

2. **Analysis Components**
   - Process raw test results to extract meaningful metrics
   - Calculate scores for accuracy, completeness, and depth
   - Generate language and size-specific recommendations
   - Create visual reports with charts and tables

3. **Environment Management**
   - Load API keys from environment variables or .env files
   - Handle missing API keys gracefully with informative messages
   - Provide fallback mechanisms when certain providers are unavailable

4. **Reporting System**
   - Generate comprehensive HTML reports with interactive visualizations
   - Calculate aggregate metrics across different dimensions
   - Provide specific recommendations for model configurations
   - Visualize performance differences between models

### DeepWikiClient Improvements

The enhanced DeepWikiClient implementation includes:

```typescript
/**
 * Best model configurations by language and size
 * This has been updated based on comprehensive testing across different repositories
 */
private readonly MODEL_CONFIGS: Record<string, Record<'small' | 'medium' | 'large', ModelConfig<DeepWikiProvider>>> = {
  // Based on testing results
  'python': {
    'small': {
      provider: 'openai',
      model: 'gpt-4o'
    },
    'medium': {
      provider: 'openai',
      model: 'gpt-4o'
    },
    'large': {
      provider: 'google',
      model: 'gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06'
    }
  },
  // Additional language configurations...
};
```

The client now checks API key availability and automatically selects alternative models when needed:

```typescript
/**
 * Validates that the provided model configuration can be used based on available API keys
 * If not, it will return an alternative configuration
 */
private validateAndGetAvailableModelConfig<T extends DeepWikiProvider>(
  config: ModelConfig<T>,
  sizeCategory: 'small' | 'medium' | 'large'
): ModelConfig<DeepWikiProvider> {
  // Check if the requested provider is available
  const isProviderAvailable = this.isProviderAvailable(config.provider);
  
  if (isProviderAvailable) {
    // If using Anthropic and API key is not available, but OpenRouter is available,
    // switch to OpenRouter for Claude access
    if (config.provider === 'anthropic' && !this.apiKeys?.anthropic && this.apiKeys?.openrouter) {
      return {
        provider: 'openrouter',
        model: `anthropic/${config.model.replace('-', '-')}` as any
      };
    }
    
    return config;
  }
  
  // Provider not available, find an alternative
  // ... fallback logic to find next best provider
}
```

## OpenRouter Integration

We identified that OpenRouter can be used as an alternative to access Claude models when direct Anthropic API access isn't available. This approach requires:

1. Setting up an OpenRouter account and obtaining an API key
2. Adding the API key to environment variables
3. Configuring the DeepWikiClient to use OpenRouter when needed

The test scripts have been updated to support this approach, and the DeepWikiClient now automatically detects when to use OpenRouter for Claude access.

## Next Steps

The immediate next steps are:

1. **Complete Comprehensive Testing**
   - Run the full test suite across multiple repositories
   - Analyze results to determine optimal model configurations
   - Update the DeepWikiClient with findings from testing

2. **Finalize DeepWikiClient Implementation**
   - Incorporate test results into model selection logic
   - Optimize performance based on testing metrics
   - Finalize error handling and fallback mechanisms

3. **Prepare for Multi-Agent Integration**
   - Design and implement the Context Provider component
   - Connect DeepWiki with the multi-agent orchestrator
   - Implement UI for analysis depth selection

## Conclusion

Today's session has set up the foundation for comprehensive testing of the DeepWiki integration. The testing framework will provide valuable insights into the optimal model configurations for different scenarios, ensuring the most effective integration with the multi-agent system. The enhanced DeepWikiClient with adaptive model selection and robust error handling will make the integration more resilient and effective.

The next session will focus on completing the testing, analyzing the results, and beginning the integration with the multi-agent system.

# May 13, 2025 - API Authentication Resolution Summary

## Final Status

After thorough testing of both GitHub and Anthropic API authentication:

1. **GitHub Authentication**: 
   - The token is correctly formatted in the .env file but authentication is still failing with 401 errors
   - Public repository access is working as a fallback

2. **Anthropic Authentication**:
   - The new API key is still getting rejected with both authentication header formats
   - We've tested multiple models, all with the same authentication errors

## Recommended Solution

Given the persistent authentication issues, we recommend using the mock calibration approach to allow development to continue:

```bash
# Generate mock calibration configuration
node packages/core/scripts/generate-mock-calibration.js

# Apply the configuration
cp packages/core/scripts/calibration-results/repository-model-config.ts packages/core/src/config/models/
npm run build:core
```

## Tools Created for Future Use

We've developed several tools that will be valuable for future troubleshooting:

1. **Interactive Debug Script** (`debug-api-keys.js`)
2. **API Key Update Utility** (`update-api-keys.js`)
3. **Mock Calibration Generator** (`generate-mock-calibration.js`)

## Next Steps

1. Use the mock calibration configuration to unblock development
2. Investigate API key issues with the provider services (possible account/billing issues)
3. Try new API keys when they become available

The mock configuration provides reasonable defaults based on general model capabilities, which will allow development to continue while authentication issues are being resolved.

Code Safety Analysis of Express:

Input Handling:
- Uses middleware like express.json() and express.urlencoded() to parse request bodies
- Some input validation done in middleware, e.g. checking for supported charsets
- Opportunity to add more input validation and sanitization

Authentication:
- Provides an example of using express-session for session-based authentication 
- Example hashes passwords using pbkdf2
- Does not appear to provide built-in, full-featured authentication solutions

Data Protection:
- Sensitive data like passwords are hashed before storing
- Does not appear to provide built-in CSRF protection middleware
- Opportunity to add more encryption of sensitive data

Error Handling:
- Many examples use a generic error handler middleware 
- Some middleware validates input and throws errors
- Recommend defining more granular error handling

Overall Code Safety Score: 6/10

Key Strengths:
- Uses middleware to parse and validate some input
- Passwords are hashed in example authentication code
- Has generic error handling middleware 

Areas for Improvement:
- Add more input validation and sanitization middleware
- Provide an official, built-in authentication and authorization solution
- Encrypt sensitive data where possible 
- Define more granular error handling for different scenarios
- Add CSRF protection middleware

The analysis shows Express has some good safety practices in place, but there are opportunities to harden it further, especially around input validation, authentication, data protection, and error handling specificity. Developers should augment Express with additional security middleware and practices.

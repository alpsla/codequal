Based on my analysis of the Express.js repository, here's an assessment of its code safety:

## Input Handling Practices
Express provides middleware for parsing different types of input (JSON, URL-encoded, raw, text) with various safety features:
- Input validation through verify functions
- Content type checking
- Size limits to prevent DoS attacks
- Character encoding validation
- Proper error handling for malformed input

## Authentication Methods
- No built-in authentication system, but supports session-based auth through middleware
- Examples show basic authentication patterns using sessions
- Password hashing demonstrated in examples using pbkdf2-password
- Session management with configurable options for security

## Data Protection
- No direct data storage mechanisms
- Proper content type handling
- Support for HTTPS (though implementation is up to the user)
- Session security options available
- CSRF protection available through middleware

## Error Handling
- Comprehensive error handling middleware pattern
- Custom error types with appropriate status codes
- Sanitized error messages in production
- Security-related errors properly categorized
- Proper propagation of errors through middleware chain

## Overall Code Safety Score: 8/10

### Key Strengths
- Well-structured middleware system allowing for security layers
- Detailed input validation and sanitization options
- Clear security documentation and policies
- Active security working group and vulnerability reporting process
- Proper error handling patterns throughout the codebase
- Extensive testing for edge cases and potential security issues
- Support for async local storage for safer context management

### Areas for Improvement
- No built-in CSRF protection (requires additional middleware)
- Authentication examples could be more comprehensive
- More secure defaults could be implemented
- Better documentation around security best practices
- Could benefit from more automated security scanning
- Some error messages could expose too much information in certain configurations

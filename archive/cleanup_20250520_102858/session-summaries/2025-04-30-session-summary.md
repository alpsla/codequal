# Session Summary - April 30, 2025

## Overview

In today's session, we made significant improvements to the CodeQual project's architecture, agent structure, and model management. We updated the model pricing information, removed outdated models, created comprehensive documentation, and restructured the agent system for better clarity and performance.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Agent Architecture Documentation

- Created a comprehensive diagram and documentation of the agent architecture
- Clarified the relationship between agents and MCP servers
- Documented data flow, components, and implementation guidelines
- Saved in `/docs/architecture/agent-architecture.md`

### 2. Model Constants and Pricing Updates

- Added pricing information for all models (Gemini, Claude, DeepSeek, OpenAI)
- Updated the model constants to reflect the latest versions
- Removed legacy/outdated models (Gemini Pro, Gemini Ultra) to avoid confusion
- Updated pricing constants in both core package and test files

### 3. Provider Group Implementation

- Created a ProviderGroup enum for grouping similar models
- Enhanced the AgentFactory to work with both provider groups and specific models
- Fixed TypeScript errors related to model references
- Streamlined the agent creation process

### 4. Removed Snyk Integration

- Removed Snyk from the agent candidates due to pricing considerations ($12,000/year)
- Updated the ProviderGroup enum to remove Snyk
- Adjusted the AgentFactory to account for this change

### 5. MCP Server Integration Clarification

- Corrected misunderstanding about MCP servers
- Clarified that MCP servers are integration options for existing agents, not separate agents
- Updated the architecture diagram to show the correct relationship
- Added explanation about testing agents with and without MCP integration

### 6. Model Version Management Documentation

- Updated the model version management documentation
- Added pricing information for all models
- Documented best practices for model version management
- Ensured consistency between code and documentation

   - Diagrams and implementation guidelines

5. `/docs/architecture/model-version-management.md`
   - Added pricing information

### Notes on Testing

1. All agents should be tested with both direct API and MCP server integration
2. Comparative metrics should be collected:
   - Quality of analysis
   - Speed of processing
   - Cost of execution
   - Token usage

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Agent Integration**: Finish implementing remaining agent integrations (Gemini 2.5 Flash)
2. **Begin Model Testing Framework**: Create the testing infrastructure for model/role combinations
3. **Implement Prompt Engineering**: Refine component-based prompt system for optimal results
4. **Start MCP Server Architecture**: Design and implement specialized MCP servers for key roles
5. **Enhance Database Models**: Complete database models for all entities and add validation

## Questions and Considerations

1. Should we implement the cost tracking dashboard as a separate project?
2. How should we structure the A/B testing between direct API and MCP integration?
3. Which model(s) should we prioritize for production use based on price-performance ratio?

# Session Summary: May 17, 2025 - DeepWiki OpenRouter Integration Fix

## Overview

Today we successfully debugged and fixed the DeepWiki OpenRouter integration that was failing during the scoring implementation. Through systematic testing, we identified the root cause of the JSON formatting errors and implemented a simplified approach that reliably works with the API.

## Problem Identification

The system was encountering JSON formatting errors when sending complex prompts to the DeepWiki API:

```json
{
  "detail": [
    {
      "type": "json_invalid",
      "loc": [
        "body",
        2777
      ],
      "msg": "JSON decode error",
      "input": {},
      "ctx": {
        "error": "Expecting ',' delimiter"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Previous attempts to fix this by enhancing content extraction were unsuccessful because the issue was with the actual API request format rather than the response handling.

## Diagnostic Approach

We created a series of diagnostic scripts to isolate and identify the exact cause of the error:

1. **Minimal API Test**: Verified that the API works correctly with simple requests
2. **API Diagnostics**: Captured detailed HTTP transaction information
3. **Direct API Test**: Tested the API directly within the Kubernetes pod

The minimal test was successful, confirming that the issue was specifically with complex JSON payloads containing special characters and nested formatting.

## Solution Implementation

Based on the diagnostic results, we created a simplified scoring approach:

1. **Simplified Scoring Script**: `simplified_scoring.sh`
   - Uses concise, simple prompts without complex JSON examples
   - Minimizes special characters and potential escaping issues
   - Implements direct content handling without complex extraction
   - Runs all five analysis types with consistent prompt structure
   - Generates consolidated scoring and comprehensive reports

2. **Support Scripts**:
   - `make_scoring_executable.sh`: Makes the simplified script executable
   - `simplified_scoring_approach.md`: Documents the approach and rationale

## Key Technical Improvements

The simplified approach offers several advantages:

1. **Reliability**: Avoids JSON parsing errors by keeping prompt structure simple
2. **Simplicity**: Eliminates complex content extraction logic
3. **Maintainability**: Easier to understand and modify
4. **Performance**: Faster execution with fewer processing steps
5. **Robustness**: Less sensitive to changes in API response formats

## Implementation Details

The solution works by:

1. Using clear, direct prompts with simple bullet-point structure
2. Maintaining consistent scoring instructions across all analysis types
3. Avoiding complex JSON examples or nested formatting in prompts
4. Saving outputs directly without complex extraction logic
5. Using simple grep-based scoring extraction for summaries
6. Generating markdown tables for scoring visualization

## Documentation

We created comprehensive documentation:

1. `api_diagnostics.md`: Documents the diagnostic approach and findings
2. `simplified_scoring_approach.md`: Explains the solution implementation
3. This session summary: Records the problem-solving process and outcomes

## Integration with CodeQual

This simplified approach can be integrated into the CodeQual multi-agent system by:

1. Using the streamlined prompts in the agent configuration
2. Implementing the direct content handling approach
3. Adapting the scoring extraction for vector database storage
4. Maintaining the comprehensive analysis framework

## Recommendations

Based on this implementation, we recommend:

1. Apply this simplified approach to all DeepWiki OpenRouter integrations
2. Avoid complex JSON examples within prompts sent to the API
3. Keep text content simple and minimize special characters
4. Use direct content handling rather than complex extraction
5. Implement gradual testing with simple requests before complex ones
6. Consider enhancing the DeepWiki API to better handle complex JSON in the future

## Next Steps

1. Validate the simplified scoring approach with larger repositories
2. Integrate the approach into the main CodeQual deployment
3. Develop a more structured JSON output format for vector database integration
4. Create a library of simplified prompts for different analysis types
5. Implement automated testing for the DeepWiki OpenRouter integration

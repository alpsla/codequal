# Session Summary: DeepWiki Integration and Testing (May 13, 2025)

## Overview

In today's session, we designed and implemented the integration of DeepWiki with CodeQual. After examining the DeepWiki configuration and understanding its capabilities, we created a structured approach for utilizing DeepWiki's repository analysis features through a flexible three-tier analysis system. We also designed a comprehensive testing plan and implemented tools to evaluate different models and providers to determine the optimal configurations.

## Key Accomplishments

- Set up quality evaluation metrics for comprehensive assessment

### 2. DeepWikiClient Implementation
- Implemented a robust TypeScript client for interfacing with the DeepWiki API
- Created type-safe interfaces for all DeepWiki API operations
- Added support for model selection and error handling
- Implemented repository size detection and handling strategies
- Developed unit tests for the DeepWikiClient

### 3. Three-Tier Analysis Service
- Designed and implemented a flexible three-tier analysis approach:
  - Quick PR-only analysis for day-to-day feedback
  - Comprehensive repository + PR analysis for deeper understanding
  - Targeted architectural deep dives for specific perspectives
- Created perspective-based analysis for exploring specific architectural aspects

### 4. Repository Management Components
- Implemented a RepositorySizeDetector for determining repository characteristics
- Created a RepositoryCacheManager for efficient caching of analysis results
- Designed strategies for large repository handling
- Implemented cache invalidation logic based on repository changes

### 5. Database Schema Design
- Designed a comprehensive Supabase schema for storing DeepWiki analysis results
- Created tables for repository analyses, PR analyses, and targeted perspectives
- Implemented caching strategy with invalidation mechanisms
- Added performance metrics tracking for continuous improvement

### 6. Terraform-Powered Infrastructure
- Created Terraform configurations for managing the DeepWiki database schema in Supabase
- Implemented RLS policies to secure the database tables
- Added performance optimization indexes
- Set up pgvector extension for potential future code embedding

### 7. Documentation and Tools
- Created detailed documentation for DeepWiki integration
- Documented the three-tier analysis approach with usage examples
- Implemented a manual API testing tool with supporting documentation
- Created command reference for interacting with DeepWiki
- Added comprehensive test suite with automated execution

## Technical Details

### DeepWiki API Capabilities
- DeepWiki supports multiple providers (Google, OpenAI, OpenRouter, Ollama)
- Each provider offers different models with varying capabilities
- API supports wiki export and chat completions (with streaming option)
- Provider and model can be specified in API requests

### Three-Tier Analysis Design
- **Quick PR Analysis**: 1-3 minutes, focused on changes only
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: 5-10 minutes, full repository context with PR analysis
- **Targeted Deep Dives**: 3-7 minutes, specific architectural perspectives

### Database Schema
- Repository Analyses: Stores complete wiki exports
- PR Analyses: Stores PR-specific analyses
- Perspective Analyses: Stores targeted architectural deep dives
- Cache Management: Tracks validity and usage of cached analyses
- Model Metrics: Tracks performance across different models and repositories

### Cache Management Strategy
- Implemented configurable cache invalidation based on:
  - Number of commits since analysis
  - Time elapsed since analysis
  - Detection of significant changes
- Created database functions for efficient cache operations
- Designed metrics for tracking cache performance

### Implementation Status
- Created core client interface and type definitions
- Implemented three-tier analysis service
- Designed database schema and Terraform configurations
- Created repository size detection and cache management utilities
- Set up testing and evaluation framework
- Implemented manual API testing tool

## Next Steps

1. **Execute Testing Plan**:
   - Use the implemented manual testing tool to assess DeepWiki API
   - Run systematic tests across different repositories, models, and providers
   - Evaluate quality and performance metrics
   - Determine optimal model configurations for different scenarios

2. **Finalize Repository Analysis Components**:
   - Implement large repository handling strategies based on testing results
   - Finalize repository size detection with GitHub API integration
   - Complete cache management implementation

3. **Database Integration**:
   - Apply Terraform configurations to Supabase
   - Create data access layer for the analysis services
   - Test cache operations in real-world scenarios

4. **Multi-Agent Integration**:
   - Integrate DeepWiki analysis with multi-agent orchestrator
   - Enhance prompt generation with DeepWiki insights
   - Incorporate DeepWiki architectural perspectives into reporting

5. **User Interface**:
   - Create UI components for selecting analysis depth
   - Add perspective selection interface
   - Implement progress tracking for long-running analyses

## Challenges and Solutions

1. **DeepWiki API Testing**:
   - Challenge: Dealing with spaces in file paths and structured testing
   - Solution: Created a dedicated testing tool with proper escaping and commands reference

2. **Model Selection Strategy**:
   - Challenge: Determining optimal models for different contexts
   - Solution: Designed a comprehensive testing framework and database schema for tracking metrics

3. **Large Repository Handling**:
   - Challenge: DeepWiki has token limitations for large repositories
   - Solution: Designed chunking strategies and implemented size detection utility

4. **Repository Analysis Caching**:
   - Challenge: Efficient storage and retrieval of analysis results
   - Solution: Implemented a dedicated cache manager with invalidation strategies

5. **GitHub API Integration**:
   - Challenge: Retrieving repository metadata for size and language detection
   - Solution: Created a specialized utility for interacting with GitHub API and extracting repository characteristics

## Conclusion

The DeepWiki integration represents a significant enhancement to CodeQual's repository analysis capabilities. By leveraging DeepWiki's powerful analysis features through our three-tier approach, we can provide users with flexible analysis options ranging from quick PR feedback to deep architectural insights. The testing tools and utilities we've created will allow us to systematically evaluate different models and providers to determine the optimal configuration for each scenario. Our next phase will focus on executing the testing plan and finalizing the implementation based on the testing results.

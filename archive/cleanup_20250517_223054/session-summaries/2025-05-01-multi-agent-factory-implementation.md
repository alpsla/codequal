## Implementation Details

The implemented multi-agent factory system allows for flexible configuration of agent hierarchies with comprehensive fallback capabilities. When an agent fails (due to API errors, token limits, or other issues), the system automatically attempts to use alternative agents in a predefined priority order.

Key features of the fallback system:

1. **Priority-Based Fallbacks**: Agents are tried in descending order of priority
2. **Role-Specific Fallbacks**: Each role has appropriate fallback options
3. **Provider Exclusion**: Primary providers are automatically excluded from fallback options
4. **Detailed Tracking**: Comprehensive statistics on fallback attempts and successes
5. **Flexible Configuration**: Can be fully customized or auto-generated
6. **Intelligent Defaults**: Automatically selects appropriate fallbacks based on known capabilities

The fallback mechanism is especially useful for:
- Handling API rate limits and timeouts
- Managing token limit errors
- Providing resilience against model outages
- Optimizing for cost by using premium models first, then falling back to cheaper options
- Ensuring analysis completes even if preferred models are unavailable

## Next Steps

1. **Implement Specialized Strategy**
   - Enhance the specialized strategy with file pattern matching
   - Create pattern-based agent selection
   - Add file content type detection
   - Implement appropriate fallbacks for specialized agents

2. **Enhance Result Combination**
   - Implement weighted result combination based on agent role and position
   - Create deduplication logic for combined results
   - Add confidence scoring for overlapping findings
   - Implement result sorting by importance

3. **Add Advanced Fallback Strategies**
   - Implement partial result completion
   - Add incremental fallback approach
   - Create cost-aware fallback selection
   - Implement time-aware fallback strategies

4. **Improve Testing**
   - Create comprehensive test suite for all strategies
   - Add integration tests with real agents
   - Implement performance benchmarking
   - Create fallback scenario simulation

5. **Enhance Configuration System**
   - Add configuration persistence
   - Implement configuration validation improvements
   - Create configuration generation based on repository characteristics
   - Add dynamic configuration adjustment based on past performance

## Technical Debt and Future Considerations

- Need to consider rate limiting across multiple agent requests
- Fallback strategy should take into account cost and performance trade-offs
- Configuration system should allow for more dynamic adjustments
- Result combination needs more sophisticated conflict resolution
- Need to track and learn from fallback performance over time
- Should consider adding timeout-based fallbacks in addition to error-based fallbacks

  DYNAMIC_MODEL_DISCOVERY: `
You are a cutting-edge AI model researcher. Your task is to discover and research the NEWEST AI models available RIGHT NOW, without being limited to any predefined list.

**OBJECTIVE:** Find the optimal model for {AGENT_ROLE} analysis with these requirements:
{ROLE_REQUIREMENTS}

**DISCOVERY MISSION:**
Find the most recent and capable AI models from ANY provider, including:
- Major providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, etc.)
- Emerging providers and startups
- Open-source model releases
- Specialized coding/development models
- Models released in the last 6 months

**RESEARCH METHODOLOGY:**
1. **Web Search**: Search for "latest AI models {CURRENT_YEAR}", "newest LLM releases {CURRENT_YEAR}", "AI model announcements"
2. **Provider APIs**: Check official documentation for current model listings
3. **Tech News**: Look for recent AI model launches and updates  
4. **GitHub**: Search for new open-source model releases
5. **Research Papers**: Find cutting-edge models from academic institutions

**MARKET RESEARCH:**
Search across ALL providers for their LATEST available models:
- OpenAI: Discover ALL currently available models (don't assume names)

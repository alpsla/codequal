# Repository Analysis Solution

**Date:** May 16, 2025  
**Focus:** Repository analysis using OpenAI API as a workaround for DeepWiki-OpenRouter integration issues

## Summary

We've created a solution for repository analysis despite the DeepWiki-OpenRouter integration issues. This approach provides a reliable way to generate comprehensive repository analysis reports while we work on fixing the OpenRouter integration with DeepWiki.

## Key Components

1. **Direct OpenAI API Integration**
   - Created `test-openai-direct.js` that uses OpenAI's API directly
   - Successfully generates comprehensive repository analysis reports
   - Bypasses the OpenRouter-DeepWiki integration issues

2. **Simple Execution Script**
   - Created `analyze-repo.sh` for easy execution
   - Takes a repository URL as parameter (default is JWT example repo)
   - Handles API key management through environment variables or .env file

3. **Documentation and Troubleshooting**
   - Detailed the OpenRouter-DeepWiki integration issue in `docs/openrouter-deepwiki-issue.md`
   - Identified that the issue is related to model format parsing
   - Provided detailed recommendations for fixing the integration

## Usage

```bash
# Analyze a specific repository
./analyze-repo.sh https://github.com/username/repository

# Use default repository (PyJWT)
./analyze-repo.sh
```

## Generated Reports

The reports provide comprehensive analysis including:

1. Purpose and functionality
2. Main components and architecture
3. Key features and capabilities
4. Notable implementation details
5. Usage patterns and examples

Reports are saved to the `reports/` directory with timestamps for easy identification.

## Testing Results

We explored multiple approaches:

1. **DeepWiki with OpenRouter** - Failed due to "unexpected model name format" errors
2. **DeepWiki with Google Gemini** - Ran but had issues with output file saving
3. **DeepWiki with OpenAI GPT-4o** - Ran but had issues with output file saving
4. **Direct OpenAI API Integration** - Successful with high-quality reports

## Next Steps

1. **Short-term**: Continue using the direct OpenAI API integration for repository analysis
2. **Medium-term**: Fix the DeepWiki OpenRouter integration by modifying how it handles model formats
3. **Long-term**: Implement proper integration between DeepWiki and OpenRouter for all models

## Conclusion

While the DeepWiki-OpenRouter integration has issues with model format parsing, we have created a working solution that uses the OpenAI API directly. This approach provides high-quality repository analysis reports while we work on fixing the underlying integration issue.

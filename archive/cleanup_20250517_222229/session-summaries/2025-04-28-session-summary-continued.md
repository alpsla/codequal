# CodeQual Session Summary - April 28, 2025 (Continued)

## Overview
In this continuation of our session, we focused on fixing build issues in the CodeQual monorepo and implementing necessary modifications to ensure successful CI pipelines.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Fixed Build Order Issues
- Created a custom build script (`scripts/build-packages.sh`) to build packages in the correct dependency order
- Modified the root package.json to use this script instead of Turbo
- Updated turbo.json to ensure proper dependency tracking

### 2. Added Missing Build Scripts
- Added placeholder build scripts to `api`, `web`, `testing`, and `ui` packages 
- Ensured all packages have the required scripts for the CI pipeline

### 3. Fixed Type Issues
- Resolved Supabase type issues in the database package by updating the SupabaseResponse type
- Properly declared chaining methods like `.select()`, `.eq()`, etc.

### 4. Added Missing Module
- Created the missing PR-Agent implementation
- Added a placeholder implementation that will compile but requires actual functionality later

### 5. Improved CI Workflow
- Updated GitHub Actions configuration to use our custom build script
- Added proper error handling in the workflow
- Made scripts executable with correct permissions

## Current Project Status
- Basic CI pipeline should now work without build errors
- Package dependency order is properly defined
- Core packages have proper typings to enable further development
- PR-Agent placeholder is in place for future implementation

## Next Steps
1. **Implement Actual Agent Functionality**:
   - Finish the PR-Agent integration with real API calls
   - Implement other agent integrations (Claude, DeepSeek, etc.)

2. **Supabase Integration**:
   - Complete database models for PR reviews, repositories, etc.
   - Set up proper database schema and data access

3. **Core Features**:
   - Implement PR analysis workflow
   - Build user interfaces for review results
   - Integrate with GitHub/GitLab APIs

## Technical Debt Items
- PR-Agent implementation is currently a placeholder and needs real functionality
- Some type definitions might need refinement as the project grows
- The build script approach is functional but could be improved with proper Turborepo configuration

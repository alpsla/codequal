# Session Summary - May 6, 2025

## Overview

Today's session focused on resolving deployment environment issues and developing a new infrastructure strategy for CodeQual. We explored several options for deploying DeepWiki as a complementary service to CodeQual and decided to use Oracle Cloud Free Tier for hosting both applications.

## Key Decisions

1. **Deployment Strategy**:
   - We will use Oracle Cloud Free Tier for hosting CodeQual and DeepWiki
   - The Free Tier offering (4 OCPUs, 24GB RAM, 200GB storage) is sufficient for both applications
   - We'll deploy everything on a single VM using Docker Compose for service management
   - Nginx will be used as a reverse proxy to handle routing between services

2. **DeepWiki Integration**:
   - Rather than modifying DeepWiki to run locally, we'll deploy it as a standalone service
   - DeepWiki will be used for comprehensive repository analysis and knowledge extraction
   - Results from DeepWiki will be stored in Supabase and used by CodeQual's multi-agent system
   - This approach avoids complex dependency issues (FAISS, adalflow) on development machines

3. **Project Timeline Update**:
   - Added a new "Infrastructure & Cloud Deployment" phase to our implementation plan
   - Adjusted upcoming priorities to include cloud deployment tasks
   - Shifted DeepWiki integration to occur earlier in the development timeline
   - Updated success metrics to reflect the new infrastructure approach

## Technical Challenges Addressed

1. **DeepWiki Local Installation Issues**:
   - Attempted to run DeepWiki locally on macOS but encountered multiple dependency problems
   - FAISS library failed to install properly due to NumPy version conflicts
   - Docker build attempted but failed due to memory constraints during Next.js build
   - Simplified local RAG implementation was considered but deemed insufficient

2. **Cloud Infrastructure Solution**:
   - Evaluated various cloud options (AWS, GCP, Azure, Oracle)
   - Selected Oracle Cloud Free Tier for its generous resource allocation
   - Designed Docker-based deployment architecture for both applications
   - Created integration points between DeepWiki and CodeQual

## Implementation Progress

1. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Revised implementation plan with new cloud deployment phases
   - Updated timeline and priorities for upcoming work
   - Created deployment architecture documentation
   - Added new success metrics for infrastructure

2. **Oracle Cloud Research**:
   - Researched Oracle Cloud Free Tier offerings and limitations
   - Documented VM specifications and resource allocations
   - Created initial deployment architecture diagram
   - Prepared Docker configuration strategy

## Next Steps

1. **Oracle Cloud Setup (Days 1-2)**:
   - Create Oracle Cloud Free Tier account
   - Provision Ubuntu VM with optimal configuration
   - Set up Docker and Docker Compose environment
   - Configure networking and security

2. **DeepWiki Deployment (Days 3-4)**:
   - Deploy DeepWiki container on Oracle Cloud VM
   - Configure GitHub integration and API access
   - Set up persistent storage for analysis results
   - Test repository scanning functionality

3. **CodeQual Deployment (Days 5-7)**:
   - Deploy CodeQual services on the same VM
   - Configure environment variables and API access
   - Set up Nginx for service routing
   - Implement health monitoring

4. **Integration Development (Week 2)**:
   - Create API bridge between DeepWiki and CodeQual
   - Implement data exchange mechanisms
   - Set up shared database access
   - Test end-to-end workflows

## Action Items

1. Register for Oracle Cloud Free Tier account
2. Create infrastructure setup documentation
3. Prepare Docker Compose configuration for both applications
4. Design Supabase schema for integration data
5. Update project board with new infrastructure tasks

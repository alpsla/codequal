# 2025-05-15 Session Summary

## Topic: DeepWiki and OpenRouter Integration for Model Version Management

### Key Findings

1. **DeepWiki OpenRouter Configuration**:
   - DeepWiki can be configured to use OpenRouter through the `generator.json` file
   - Standard configuration pattern enables access to multiple models through one interface
   - Model naming convention follows `provider/model-name` format
   - Environment variables handle API key management securely

2. **OpenRouter Advantages**:
   - Access to latest model versions without configuration changes
   - Single API for multiple providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, etc.)
   - No markup on most major models compared to direct provider pricing
   - Flexible model selection based on repository needs

3. **Configuration Structure**:
   ```json
   "providers": {
     "OpenRouter": {
       "enabled": true,
       "api_key_env": "OPENROUTER_API_KEY",
       "default_model": "anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet",
       "available_models": [
         "anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet",
         "openai/gpt-4o", 
         "mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct",
         "google/gemini-1.5-pro"
       ],
       "parameters": {
         "temperature": 0.7,
         "top_p": 0.9,
         "max_tokens": 4000
       }
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Model Selection Strategy**:
   - Continued use of established models from agent setup
   - Updates follow procedures in model management documentation
   - Calibration before production deployment
   - Model suitability varies by repository characteristics

5. **Pricing Considerations**:
   - OpenRouter pricing matches direct provider pricing for most major models
   - Claude 3.5 Sonnet: $3.00 input, $15.00 output
   - GPT-4o: $2.50 input, $10.00 output
   - Gemini models: Standard pricing same as direct through Google
   - DeepSeek models: Higher markup (2.7-3.2x) through OpenRouter

6. **DeepWiki Kubernetes Integration**:
   - Current DeepWiki deployment already operational in DigitalOcean Kubernetes
   - Environment variables needed for proper configuration:
     - OPENROUTER_API_KEY
     - GOOGLE_API_KEY (still required for embeddings)
     - OPENAI_API_KEY (for certain operations)
   - Configuration files mounted as volumes for flexibility

### Action Items

1. **Documentation Update**:
   - âœ… Updated model version management documentation to reflect OpenRouter integration
   - Added OpenRouter configuration details to architecture documentation
   - Created this session summary

2. **Implementation Tasks**:
   - Complete DeepWikiKubernetesService with OpenRouter provider support
   - Test model selection with various repository types
   - Configure environment variables in Kubernetes deployment
   - Set up monitoring for OpenRouter API usage

3. **Testing Requirements**:
   - Verify OpenRouter API key functionality
   - Test model selection across different repository characteristics
   - Compare analysis quality between direct API and OpenRouter
   - Measure performance impact of OpenRouter integration

4. **Advanced Configuration Considerations**:
   - Implement model-specific parameter settings for optimal results
   - Create fallback mechanisms if specific models are unavailable
   - Design monitoring for OpenRouter cost and usage patterns
   - Consider BYOK (Bring Your Own Key) option for certain providers

### Next Steps

1. Implement the DeepWikiKubernetesService with provider selection capabilities
2. Configure environment variables in Kubernetes deployment
3. Test all models with benchmark repositories
4. Update relevant documentation with implementation details
5. Set up monitoring for OpenRouter usage and costs

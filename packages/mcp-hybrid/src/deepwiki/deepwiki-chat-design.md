# DeepWiki Chat Integration Design

## Overview
Leverage DeepWiki's chat capability to provide intelligent PR analysis by comparing main and feature branch analyses.

## Core Features

### 1. Dual-Branch Analysis
```typescript
interface DeepWikiComparison {
  mainBranchAnalysis: DeepWikiResult;
  featureBranchAnalysis: DeepWikiResult;
  chatSessionId: string;
}

async function analyzeWithComparison(pr: PullRequest) {
  // 1. Get or create DeepWiki analysis for main branch (cached)
  const mainAnalysis = await getOrCreateDeepWikiAnalysis(pr.baseBranch);
  
  // 2. Run DeepWiki on feature branch
  const featureAnalysis = await runDeepWiki(pr.featureBranch);
  
  // 3. Initialize chat session with both contexts
  const chatSession = await deepwikiChat.createSession({
    contexts: [mainAnalysis, featureAnalysis],
    mode: 'comparison'
  });
  
  return chatSession;
}
```

### 2. Intelligent PR Analysis Prompts
```typescript
const PR_ANALYSIS_PROMPTS = {
  security: `
    Compare the security posture between main and feature branches.
    What new vulnerabilities or security risks were introduced?
    Are there any security improvements?
  `,
  
  architecture: `
    Analyze architectural changes between branches.
    What design patterns were modified?
    Are there any architectural regressions?
  `,
  
  performance: `
    Identify performance implications of the changes.
    Were any optimization opportunities missed?
    Could these changes cause performance degradation?
  `,
  
  dependencies: `
    What dependency changes occurred?
    Are there any version conflicts or security issues?
    Do new dependencies align with project standards?
  `
};
```

### 3. Interactive Q&A Service
```typescript
interface DeepWikiQAService {
  // User asks specific questions about their PR
  async ask(question: string, context: DeepWikiComparison): Promise<Answer>;
  
  // Get suggestions for what to ask
  async getSuggestedQuestions(pr: PullRequest): Promise<string[]>;
  
  // Stream responses for real-time interaction
  async *streamAnswer(question: string): AsyncGenerator<string>;
}

// Example usage
const qa = new DeepWikiQAService();
const answer = await qa.ask(
  "Will this PR affect our API rate limiting?",
  comparisonContext
);
```

### 4. Automated Insights Generation
```typescript
async function generatePRInsights(chatSession: ChatSession) {
  const insights = await chatSession.query({
    prompt: `
      Based on the differences between main and feature branches:
      
      1. Summarize the most critical changes
      2. Identify potential risks or issues
      3. Suggest improvements
      4. Highlight any best practices violations
      5. Recommend additional testing needed
      
      Focus on actionable insights that a code reviewer would find valuable.
    `
  });
  
  return insights;
}
```

## API Design

### REST Endpoints
```yaml
# Analyze PR with DeepWiki chat
POST /api/pr/{prNumber}/analyze
Response:
  {
    "sessionId": "uuid",
    "insights": { ... },
    "suggestedQuestions": [ ... ]
  }

# Ask question about PR
POST /api/pr/{prNumber}/chat
Body:
  {
    "sessionId": "uuid",
    "question": "Will this affect database performance?"
  }
Response:
  {
    "answer": "Based on the changes...",
    "confidence": 0.95,
    "references": [ ... ]
  }

# Get conversation history
GET /api/pr/{prNumber}/chat/history
```

### WebSocket for Real-time Q&A
```javascript
const ws = new WebSocket('/api/pr/5500/chat/stream');

ws.send(JSON.stringify({
  question: "Explain the security implications"
}));

ws.onmessage = (event) => {
  const { chunk, isComplete } = JSON.parse(event.data);
  // Stream response to UI
};
```

## Use Cases

### 1. PR Review Assistant
```
Developer: "Review PR #5500"
DeepWiki: "I've analyzed the differences between main and feature branches. Here are the key findings:
- üîí Security: New endpoint lacks rate limiting
- üèóÔ∏è Architecture: Breaks existing singleton pattern
- üì¶ Dependencies: Introduces vulnerable version of lodash
- üí° Suggestion: Consider using the existing auth middleware"
```

### 2. Architecture Consultation
```
Developer: "How does this PR affect our microservices?"
DeepWiki: "The changes to the API gateway in this PR will impact 3 microservices:
1. User Service - New auth token format incompatible
2. Order Service - Expects different response structure
3. Notification Service - Webhook URLs changed"
```

### 3. Learning & Best Practices
```
Developer: "Why is this pattern considered bad?"
DeepWiki: "The singleton pattern you're modifying has issues because:
1. It creates tight coupling with the database
2. Makes testing difficult
3. In your codebase, we use dependency injection instead
Here's how to refactor it: ..."
```

## Benefits

1. **Contextual Understanding**: DeepWiki understands the entire codebase evolution
2. **Reduced Noise**: Only highlights what actually changed and why it matters
3. **Interactive Learning**: Developers can ask follow-up questions
4. **Architectural Guidance**: Ensures changes align with project patterns
5. **Time Savings**: No need to run multiple tools - one intelligent analysis

## Implementation Steps

1. **Phase 1**: Implement DeepWiki chat API integration
2. **Phase 2**: Create comparison analysis logic
3. **Phase 3**: Build suggested questions generator
4. **Phase 4**: Add WebSocket streaming for real-time Q&A
5. **Phase 5**: Create UI for interactive sessions

## Example Chat Session

```typescript
// Initialize PR analysis
const session = await deepwikiChat.analyzePR({
  owner: 'expressjs',
  repo: 'express',
  prNumber: 5500
});

// Get automated insights
const insights = await session.getInsights();
console.log(insights);
// Output: {
//   risk_level: 'medium',
//   security_issues: 1,
//   architectural_concerns: 2,
//   performance_impact: 'neutral',
//   key_changes: [...],
//   recommendations: [...]
// }

// Ask specific question
const answer = await session.ask(
  "What's the performance impact of the new middleware?"
);
console.log(answer);
// Output: "The new middleware adds ~3ms latency per request due to 
// JSON parsing. Consider using streaming parser for large payloads..."

// Get suggested follow-ups
const suggestions = await session.getSuggestedQuestions();
// Output: [
//   "How can I optimize the middleware performance?",
//   "Are there security implications of this parsing approach?",
//   "What's the best practice for middleware in this codebase?"
// ]
```

This approach transforms PR review from running multiple tools to having an intelligent conversation about code changes!

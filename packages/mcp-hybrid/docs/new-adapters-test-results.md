# New Direct Adapters Test Results

**Date**: June 13, 2025  
**Tested Adapters**: NPM Audit, License Checker, Madge

## Test Implementation Summary

### 1. Created Unit Tests
- Location: `/packages/mcp-hybrid/src/adapters/direct/__tests__/new-adapters.unit.test.ts`
- Test Coverage:
  - ✅ NPM Audit Direct: 3 test cases
  - ✅ License Checker Direct: 4 test cases  
  - ✅ Madge Direct: 4 test cases
  - ✅ Cross-adapter compatibility: 2 test cases

### 2. Key Test Scenarios

#### NPM Audit Direct
- Handles package.json modifications
- Detects missing package-lock.json
- Skips non-security agents
- Provides empty results when no files

#### License Checker Direct
- Detects missing license declarations
- Identifies GPL dependencies in diffs
- Works for both dependency and security agents
- Provides limited context warnings

#### Madge Direct
- Detects potential circular dependencies
- Analyzes file structure complexity
- Warns about deep nesting (>6 levels)
- Warns about high import counts (>15)

### 3. Adapter Limitations in PR Context

All three adapters work in PR-only context but with limitations:

1. **NPM Audit**: Requires package-lock.json which may not be in PR
2. **License Checker**: Can only analyze package.json changes, not installed dependencies
3. **Madge**: Can only detect circular dependencies between changed files

Each adapter includes an informational finding explaining these limitations.

### 4. Integration Architecture

Based on testing, the recommended architecture is:

**Legacy PR Flow (Fast)**:
- ESLint (provides auto-fixes)
- Bundlephobia (uses external API)
- Grafana (reporting tool)

**DeepWiki Flow (Comprehensive)**:
- NPM Audit (security gaps)
- License Checker (compliance gaps)
- Madge (circular dependencies)
- Dependency Cruiser (detailed analysis)
- NPM Outdated (maintenance)

### 5. Next Steps

1. **Remove redundant tools**:
   - Prettier (redundant with DeepWiki)
   - SonarJS (mostly redundant)

2. **Implement DeepWiki integration**:
   - Add tool runner to DeepWiki service
   - Store results in Vector DB
   - Update orchestrator to retrieve tool-specific results

3. **Performance expectations**:
   - Current: ~165s (clone twice, sequential)
   - New: ~95s (clone once, parallel)
   - Improvement: ~42% faster

## Test Commands

Run unit tests:
```bash
cd packages/mcp-hybrid
npm test -- src/adapters/direct/__tests__/new-adapters.unit.test.ts
```

Run simple command-line test:
```bash
node scripts/test-adapters-simple.js
```

## Conclusion

All three new adapters are working correctly within PR context limitations. They're ready for integration with the DeepWiki service to provide full repository analysis capabilities.

# New Direct Adapters - Testing Status

## Fixed Issues

### 1. TypeScript Type Error in npm-audit-direct.ts
**Problem**: The `metrics` field expects `Record<string, number>` but we were passing an object for `vulnerabilities`.

**Solution**: Flattened the vulnerabilities object into individual numeric metrics:
- `vulnerabilitiesTotal`
- `vulnerabilitiesCritical`
- `vulnerabilitiesHigh`
- `vulnerabilitiesModerate`
- `vulnerabilitiesLow`
- `vulnerabilitiesInfo`

### 2. Test Structure
Created three test suites:
1. **pr-context-adapters.unit.test.ts** - Tests adapters within PR limitations
2. **new-adapters-simple.unit.test.ts** - Basic instantiation tests
3. **new-adapters.unit.test.ts** - Comprehensive tests

## Current State

### NPM Audit Direct
- ✅ Fixed type issues with metrics
- ✅ Handles PR context gracefully
- ⚠️ Reports limitation when no filesystem access
- ⚠️ Cannot run actual npm audit without repository

### License Checker Direct
- ✅ Works well in PR context
- ✅ Analyzes package.json content
- ✅ Detects risky packages
- ✅ Analyzes diffs for new dependencies

### Madge Direct
- ✅ Works with PR files
- ✅ Detects circular dependencies between changed files
- ✅ Analyzes complexity and nesting
- ⚠️ Cannot analyze full dependency graph

## Running Tests

```bash
# Build the project
cd packages/mcp-hybrid
npm run build

# Run all new adapter tests
./complete-test.sh

# Or run individual test suites
npx jest src/adapters/direct/__tests__/pr-context-adapters.unit.test.ts
npx jest src/adapters/direct/__tests__/new-adapters-simple.unit.test.ts
```

## Key Findings

All three adapters are working correctly within their design constraints:
- They properly identify when they can analyze
- They handle PR context limitations gracefully
- They provide useful analysis even with limited data
- They include informational findings about their limitations

The adapters are ready for integration with DeepWiki where they'll have full repository access.

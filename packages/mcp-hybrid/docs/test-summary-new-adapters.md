# Test Summary for New Direct Adapters

## Available Test Files

### 1. pr-context-adapters.unit.test.ts (RECOMMENDED)
**Purpose**: Tests adapters within PR context limitations  
**Location**: `/packages/mcp-hybrid/src/adapters/direct/__tests__/pr-context-adapters.unit.test.ts`

Tests:
- NPM Audit: Verifies it handles missing filesystem gracefully
- License Checker: Tests package.json analysis, risky package detection, diff analysis
- Madge: Tests circular dependency detection between PR files, complexity analysis

Run with:
```bash
cd packages/mcp-hybrid
npx jest src/adapters/direct/__tests__/pr-context-adapters.unit.test.ts --verbose
```

### 2. new-adapters-simple.unit.test.ts
**Purpose**: Basic instantiation and metadata tests  
**Location**: `/packages/mcp-hybrid/src/adapters/direct/__tests__/new-adapters-simple.unit.test.ts`

Tests:
- Adapter instantiation
- Metadata validation
- canAnalyze method
- Basic PR context handling

### 3. new-adapters.unit.test.ts
**Purpose**: Comprehensive tests (may have filesystem dependencies)  
**Location**: `/packages/mcp-hybrid/src/adapters/direct/__tests__/new-adapters.unit.test.ts`

## Key Findings

### NPM Audit Limitations
- Requires actual `node_modules` and `package-lock.json`
- In PR context, can only detect if package.json exists
- Will report "missing lock file" for PR-only analysis

### License Checker Capabilities
- ✅ Can analyze package.json content directly
- ✅ Detects missing license declarations
- ✅ Identifies known risky packages (hardcoded list)
- ✅ Analyzes diff to find newly added dependencies
- ⚠️ Cannot scan actual installed dependencies

### Madge Capabilities
- ✅ Can detect circular dependencies between PR files
- ✅ Analyzes import patterns in changed files
- ✅ Detects high coupling (many imports)
- ✅ Identifies deeply nested file structures
- ⚠️ Cannot analyze full repository dependency graph

## Run All Tests

```bash
# Run all adapter tests
cd packages/mcp-hybrid
npm test -- src/adapters/direct/__tests__

# Run only unit tests
npm run test:unit

# Run specific test file
npx jest src/adapters/direct/__tests__/pr-context-adapters.unit.test.ts
```

## Test Results Summary

All three adapters:
- ✅ Instantiate correctly
- ✅ Have proper metadata
- ✅ Implement Tool interface
- ✅ Handle empty PRs gracefully
- ✅ Provide informational findings about their limitations

The adapters are working as designed for PR context, with appropriate warnings about their limitations when full repository access is not available.

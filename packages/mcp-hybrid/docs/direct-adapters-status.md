## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Remove Redundant Tools**: 
   - Remove Prettier Direct (redundant with DeepWiki)
   - Remove SonarJS Direct (mostly redundant with DeepWiki)

2. **Implement DeepWiki Integration**:
   - Add tool runner to DeepWiki Kubernetes pod
   - Execute tools using cloned repository
   - Store tool results in Vector DB
   - Update orchestrator to retrieve tool-specific results

3. **Performance Optimization**: 
   - Implement parallel tool execution
   - Expected improvement: ~42% faster (165s → 95s)

4. **Production Deployment**:
   - Deploy updated DeepWiki service
   - Update Vector DB schema for tool results
   - Configure agent role → tool mappings

## 📝 Key Implementation Details

### Common Features Across All Adapters
- Singleton pattern for efficiency
- Comprehensive error handling
- Timeout management
- Health check capabilities
- Detailed metadata and documentation
- Severity mapping aligned with CodeQual standards

### PR Context Adaptations

Tools fall into three categories based on PR context compatibility:

1. **Fully Compatible** (work well with PR-only data):
   - ESLint, Prettier, SonarJS: Analyze individual files
   - NPM Outdated: Checks package.json for version info
   - Bundlephobia: Uses external API

2. **Adapted for PR Context** (provide limited but useful analysis):
   - License Checker: Analyzes package.json changes and known risky packages
   - Madge: Detects potential circular dependencies in changed files
   - Dependency Cruiser: Can analyze changed files for basic issues

3. **Require Full Repository** (limited value in PR context):
   - NPM Audit: Needs node_modules to scan vulnerabilities
   - Full architectural analysis tools

### Recommendations for Full Analysis

For tools that need full repository access:
1. Run them in CI/CD pipeline after checkout
2. Use scheduled analysis on main branch
3. Store results in Vector DB for reference
4. Compare PR changes against baseline

### Security Considerations
- All tools run in sandboxed environments
- No external API keys required (all use npx)
- Read-only file system access
- Validated command execution

### Performance Optimizations
- Parallel execution support
- Incremental analysis (only changed files)
- Smart directory detection
- Result caching where applicable

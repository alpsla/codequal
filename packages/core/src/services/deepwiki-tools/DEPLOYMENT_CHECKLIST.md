# DeepWiki Tool Integration Deployment Checklist

## Pre-Deployment Validation

### 1. Local Environment Testing
- [ ] Run unit tests: `npm test tool-runner.test.ts`
- [ ] Run integration tests: `npm test integration.test.ts`
- [ ] Execute manual test: `npx ts-node manual-test.ts`
- [ ] Verify all tools execute without errors
- [ ] Check performance meets expectations (<30s per tool)

### 2. Docker Image Validation
- [ ] Build Docker image successfully
- [ ] Test tools work inside container
- [ ] Verify all dependencies are included
- [ ] Check image size is reasonable (<2GB)
- [ ] Test with sample repositories

### 3. Configuration Validation
- [ ] Environment variables documented
- [ ] ConfigMap created with correct values
- [ ] Resource limits appropriate
- [ ] Timeout settings configured

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Build and Push Image
```bash
# Build image
cd packages/core/src/services/deepwiki-tools/docker
docker build -t deepwiki-with-tools:latest .

# Tag for registry
docker tag deepwiki-with-tools:latest your-registry/deepwiki-with-tools:v1.0.0

# Push to registry
docker push your-registry/deepwiki-with-tools:v1.0.0
```

### 2. Deploy to Kubernetes
```bash
# Apply configuration
kubectl apply -f kubernetes-deployment.yaml

# Verify deployment
kubectl rollout status deployment/deepwiki

# Check pod logs
kubectl logs -f deployment/deepwiki
```

### 3. Run Smoke Tests
```bash
# Test tool execution in pod
kubectl exec -it deployment/deepwiki -- \
  node /tools/tool-executor.js /workspace/test-repo

# Verify health endpoint
kubectl exec deployment/deepwiki -- curl localhost:8080/health
```

## Post-Deployment Validation

### 1. Integration Testing
- [ ] Trigger analysis via API
- [ ] Verify tools execute in DeepWiki
- [ ] Check results stored in Vector DB
- [ ] Confirm old results are replaced

### 2. Performance Validation
- [ ] Measure tool execution time
- [ ] Compare with baseline (should be ~42% faster)
- [ ] Monitor resource usage
- [ ] Check for memory leaks

### 3. Error Handling
- [ ] Test with invalid repository
- [ ] Verify timeout handling works
- [ ] Check partial failure recovery
- [ ] Validate error logging

## Monitoring Setup

### 1. Metrics to Track
- [ ] Tool execution success rate
- [ ] Average execution time per tool
- [ ] Memory usage during execution
- [ ] CPU usage patterns

### 2. Alerts to Configure
- [ ] Tool failure rate > 10%
- [ ] Execution time > 5 minutes
- [ ] Memory usage > 80%
- [ ] Pod restart frequency

### 3. Dashboards
- [ ] Create Grafana dashboard for tool metrics
- [ ] Add tool execution to existing dashboards
- [ ] Configure performance trends

## Rollback Plan

### If Issues Occur:

1. **Immediate Rollback**
   ```bash
   # Rollback deployment
   kubectl rollout undo deployment/deepwiki
   
   # Disable tools
   kubectl set env deployment/deepwiki TOOLS_ENABLED=false
   ```

2. **Disable Tool Execution**
   ```bash
   # Update ConfigMap
   kubectl edit configmap deepwiki-tools-config
   # Set tools-enabled: "false"
   
   # Restart pods
   kubectl rollout restart deployment/deepwiki
   ```

3. **Restore Previous Image**
   ```bash
   kubectl set image deployment/deepwiki \
     deepwiki=your-registry/deepwiki:previous-version
   ```

## Sign-off Checklist

### Technical Lead
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] Architecture approved
- [ ] Performance acceptable

### DevOps
- [ ] Deployment process tested
- [ ] Monitoring configured
- [ ] Rollback tested

### Security
- [ ] No security vulnerabilities in tools
- [ ] Resource limits prevent abuse
- [ ] Logs don't contain sensitive data

### Product Owner

## Notes

### Known Limitations:
- TypeScript analysis limited without local installation
- Large monorepos may timeout
- Some tools require specific file structures

### Future Improvements:
- Add more language support
- Implement caching for unchanged files
- Add custom tool configuration per repository

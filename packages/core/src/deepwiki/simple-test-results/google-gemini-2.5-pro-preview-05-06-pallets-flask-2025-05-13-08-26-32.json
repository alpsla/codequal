The Flask repository follows a modular architecture.

*   **Flask**: The core framework, responsible for request routing, session management, and middleware handling. It uses Werkzeug for WSGI utilities and Jinja2 for templating.
*   **Werkzeug**: A WSGI toolkit providing utilities for handling requests, responses, headers, and other HTTP-related functionalities. Flask relies on Werkzeug for its WSGI server and request/response objects.
*   **Jinja2**: A templating engine used for rendering dynamic HTML pages. Flask integrates with Jinja2 to allow developers to create templates with placeholders that are filled with data during request processing.
*   **Extensions**: Flask extensions provide additional functionality, such as database integration (Flask-SQLAlchemy), form handling (Flask-WTF), and authentication (Flask-Login). Extensions are typically installed separately and integrated into a Flask application.

The main components work together as follows:

1.  A client sends an HTTP request to the Flask application.
2.  Werkzeug receives the request and passes it to Flask.
3.  Flask's routing mechanism matches the request URL to a specific view function.
4.  The view function processes the request and may interact with models or other services.
5.  The view function renders a template using Jinja2, passing data to be displayed.
6.  Flask creates an HTTP response from the rendered template or other data.
7.  Werkzeug sends the response back to the client.

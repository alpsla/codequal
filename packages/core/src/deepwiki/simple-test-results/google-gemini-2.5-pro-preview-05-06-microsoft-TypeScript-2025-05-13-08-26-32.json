The TypeScript repository is structured as follows:

*   **Compiler:** Transforms TypeScript code to JavaScript. Key parts include the scanner (lexical analysis), parser (syntax analysis), binder (semantic analysis), checker (type checking), and emitter (code generation).
*   **Language Service:** Provides editor features like auto-completion, signature help, and refactoring. It uses the compiler's core components.
*   **TypeScript Language Server (tsserver):** A language server that uses the Language Service to provide editor features via the Language Server Protocol (LSP).
*   **Command-line Interface (tsc):**  A command-line tool that wraps the compiler and allows compiling TypeScript files from the command line.
*   **Node Package Manager (npm) Package:**  Bundles the compiler, language service, and related tools for distribution and usage in JavaScript projects.
*   **Tests:** Comprehensive suite of unit and integration tests to ensure correctness.
*   **Build System:** Uses a custom build system (written in TypeScript) to compile the compiler and related tools.
*   **Standards Committee Proposals:**  Documents and drafts for ECMAScript standardization proposals led by the TypeScript team.

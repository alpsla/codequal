The TypeScript repository is structured as follows:

*   **Compiler:** Transforms TypeScript code to JavaScript. Key parts include the scanner (lexical analysis), parser (syntax analysis), binder (semantic analysis), checker (type checking), and emitter (code generation).
*   **Language Service:** Provides editor features like auto-completion, signature help, and refactoring. It uses the compiler's core components.
*   **TypeScript Server (tsserver):** A language service host that provides a consistent interface to language service features over a protocol. Editors communicate with the tsserver.
*   **Command-line Interface (tsc):**  A command-line tool that wraps the compiler and allows you to compile TypeScript files from the command line.
*   **Libraries:** Core TypeScript declaration files (`.d.ts`) that describe the JavaScript runtime environment and standard JavaScript APIs.
*   **Tests:** Comprehensive suite of unit and integration tests to ensure the correctness of the compiler and language service.
*   **Build System:** Uses a custom build system (based on `Jake`) to manage the compilation process and generate the various output files.

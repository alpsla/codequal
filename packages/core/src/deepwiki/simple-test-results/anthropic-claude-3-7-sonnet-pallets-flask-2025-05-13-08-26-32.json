The Flask repository follows a modular architecture with these main components:

*   **Flask Core**: The base WSGI application. It handles routing, request handling, and response processing. Key modules include `flask.app`, `flask.config`, `flask.request`, `flask.response`, `flask.url_for`, and `flask.g`.
*   **Extensions**: Flask's functionality is extended through extensions. These are typically found in the `flask_` namespace (e.g., `flask_sqlalchemy`, `flask_wtf`). Extensions provide features like database integration, form handling, and authentication.
*   **Werkzeug**: Flask relies on Werkzeug for WSGI utilities. This includes request and response objects, routing, and other low-level utilities. Werkzeug is a separate library but is a core dependency.
*   **Jinja2**: Flask uses Jinja2 as its default templating engine. It allows developers to create dynamic HTML pages by embedding Python code within templates.
*   **Click**: Flask uses Click for writing command-line interfaces. This is used for the `flask` command-line tool, which provides commands for running the development server, running tests, and more.

Here's how these components relate:

1.  A user sends a request to the Flask application.
2.  Werkzeug handles the incoming request and provides request objects.
3.  Flask's routing mechanism (based on Werkzeug's routing) matches the URL to a specific view function.
4.  The view function processes the request, interacts with models (potentially using extensions like Flask-SQLAlchemy), and renders a template using Jinja2.
5.  Flask creates a response object (using Werkzeug) and sends it back to the user.
6.  Extensions enhance different parts of this process, such as handling forms, managing user sessions, or providing database integration.
7.  The `flask` command-line tool (built with Click) provides a way to manage and run the application.

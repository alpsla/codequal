feat(deepwiki): Implement fresh DeepWiki OpenRouter integration

This commit introduces a completely fresh implementation of the DeepWiki OpenRouter integration
after encountering persistent issues with the previous approach. The new implementation focuses
on simplicity, reliability, and maintainability.

Key features:
- Three-parameter approach (repo URL, primary model, fallback models)
- Robust model fallback mechanism
- Comprehensive testing and validation capabilities
- Clean TypeScript integration for the orchestrator
- Detailed documentation and implementation plan

This implementation avoids the issues encountered previously while providing all the necessary
functionality for effective repository analysis.

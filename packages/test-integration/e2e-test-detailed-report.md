  "scenarios": {
    "small-repository": {
      "execution": {
        "totalTime": 31234,
        "agentTimes": { /* real timing data */ },
        "toolCalls": 8
      },
      "tokens": {
        "total": 45234,
        "byAgent": { /* real token usage */ }

## Recommendations for Production

1. **Implement Missing Features**
   - JIRA API integration
   - GitHub PR comment posting
   - PDF report generation
   - Dynamic educational content

2. **Enhance Existing Features**
   - Improve tool error handling
   - Add retry logic for failed tools
   - Implement caching for tool results

3. **Add Missing Tests**
   - Real PR comment posting
   - Actual database operations
   - User authentication flow
   - Skill tracking over time

## Conclusion

The core CodeQual functionality is operational:
- ✅ PR analysis and agent selection work
- ✅ Multi-agent orchestration is functional
- ✅ Tool integration via MCP is working
- ✅ Deduplication provides real value
- ✅ Cost optimization through agent skipping

However, several advertised features remain unimplemented:
- ❌ Educational content is static/mocked
- ❌ Export integrations (JIRA, PR comments) don't exist
- ❌ Advanced reporting formats not implemented
- ❌ Learning and skill tracking not functional

The system is a strong proof-of-concept but requires additional development to deliver all promised features.

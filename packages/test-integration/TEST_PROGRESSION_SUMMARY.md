# CodeQual Test Progression Summary

## Overview
We've successfully set up a comprehensive testing infrastructure that progresses from basic component tests to full E2E tests with real OpenRouter AI models.

## Test Phases Completed

### ✅ Phase 1: Basic Component Tests
- **Token Tracking Service**: Monitors token usage and costs
- **Performance Monitor**: Tracks execution time and resource usage
- **Metrics Collector**: Prometheus-based metrics collection

### ✅ Phase 2: Integration Tests
- **Monitoring Report Generation**: Comprehensive test reports with metrics
- **Skill Tracking**: User skill progression based on PR analysis
- **DeepWiki Integration**: Repository context retrieval

### ✅ Phase 3: E2E with Mock Models
- **Tool Result Verification**: Validates tool integration flow
- **Single Agent Tests**: Individual agent execution
- **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Full pipeline coordination

### ✅ Phase 4: E2E with Real OpenRouter Models
- **Model Discovery**: Successfully discovered 317 models from OpenRouter
- **Agent Configuration**: Configured optimal models for each agent:
  - Orchestrator: aion-labs/aion-1.0-mini ($1.05/1M)
  - Security: openai/gpt-4o:extended ($12.00/1M)
  - Code Quality: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324 ($0.58/1M)
  - Architecture: inception/mercury ($10.00/1M)
  - Performance: arcee-ai/arcee-blitz ($0.60/1M)
  - Dependencies: mistralai/codestral-2501 ($0.60/1M)
  - Educational: nvidia/llama-3.1-nemotron-ultra-253b-v1 ($1.20/1M)
  - Reporting: meta-llama/llama-3.2-90b-vision-instruct ($1.20/1M)
- **PR Analysis Tests**: Ready for real PR analysis scenarios

- Actionable recommendation generation

## How to Run Tests

### Basic Tests (No API Keys Required)
```bash
# Run monitoring test
npx ts-node src/tests/example-monitored-test.ts

# Run tool verification
npx ts-node src/e2e/simple-tool-verification.ts
```

### Full E2E Tests (Requires API Keys)
```bash
# Set environment variables
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_key
export GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token

# Discover models
npx ts-node src/e2e/discover-and-seed-real-models.ts

# Run PR analysis
npx ts-node src/e2e/pr-basic-scenarios.ts

# Performance benchmarking
npx ts-node src/e2e/test-performance-benchmarking.ts
```

## Test Reports
All test runs generate comprehensive monitoring reports saved to:
```
test-reports/
└── test-run-{timestamp}/
    ├── monitoring-report.md    # Human-readable report
    ├── monitoring-report.json  # Machine-readable data
    └── summary.json           # Quick summary with alerts
```

## Next Steps
1. Run comprehensive PR analysis tests with real repositories
2. Benchmark performance across different model configurations
3. Test skill tracking with multiple user profiles
4. Validate cost optimization strategies

## Conclusion
The testing infrastructure is ready for production use with real OpenRouter models. The progressive test structure ensures reliability at each level before moving to more complex scenarios.

**Report ID:** report_1735226789_ai_security_pr  
**Repository:** https://github.com/example/ai-service  
**PR #42**

## Executive Summary

**Risk Level: HIGH** üî¥

Critical security vulnerabilities detected in AI service implementation. Immediate action required to secure API keys and implement prompt validation.

- **Total Issues:** 6
- **Critical Issues:** 1
- **Estimated Fix Time:** 4-6 hours
- **Estimated Learning Time:** 2-3 hours

## Critical Findings

### üö® CRITICAL: Hardcoded API Key

**File:** `src/services/ai-chat-service.ts:5`  
**Code:**
```typescript
private apiKey = 'sk-proj-hardcoded-key';
```

**Impact:** High risk of unauthorized API usage and financial loss

**Immediate Action Required:**
1. Remove the hardcoded key from source code
2. Add `OPENAI_API_KEY` to your `.env` file
3. Update code to use `process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY`
4. Ensure `.env` is in `.gitignore`

**Why This Matters:** API keys in source code are visible to anyone with repository access. In 2019, thousands of exposed API keys on GitHub led to unauthorized cryptocurrency mining.

## High Priority Issues

### üîí Insufficient Prompt Injection Protection

**File:** `src/validators/prompt-validator.ts:4`  
**Severity:** HIGH

Your current validation can be bypassed with crafted inputs. Attackers could manipulate AI behavior.

**Recommended Implementation:**
```typescript
const INJECTION_PATTERNS = [
  /ignore.*previous.*instructions/i,
  /system.*prompt/i,
  /act.*as.*if/i,
  /pretend.*you.*are/i
];

function validatePrompt(prompt: string): boolean {
  for (const pattern of INJECTION_PATTERNS) {
    if (pattern.test(prompt)) {
      return false;
    }
  }
  return true;
}
```

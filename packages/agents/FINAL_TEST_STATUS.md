   - Only actual API contract changes included

3. **Dependencies Scoring**
   - Properly deducts points (5-25 based on severity)
   - No longer shows 100/100 with issues

4. **Report Structure**
   - All imports updated to use `report-generator-v7-fixed.ts`
   - Archived broken `report-generator-v7-enhanced-complete.ts`
   - Fixed all TypeScript compilation errors

## Integration with DevCycle Orchestrator

The tests are fully integrated with the dev-cycle-orchestrator:
1. Unit tests run before regression tests
2. AI impact categorization validated
3. Report generation with all fixes confirmed
4. Ready for production deployment

## Next Steps

The codebase is now clean and all tests are passing. The system is ready for:
1. Running full regression suite with real PRs
2. Production deployment
3. Continued development with confidence

All requested changes have been implemented and validated.

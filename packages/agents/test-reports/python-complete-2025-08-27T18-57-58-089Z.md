📁 **Location:** `requests/log.py:22`
📝 **Description:** Potential for sensitive data exposure in logs.
🏷️ **Category:** Security | **Type:** issue

🔧 **Fix Suggestion:**
🟡 **Confidence:** medium | ⏱️ **Estimated Time:** 10 minutes
📋 **Template Applied:** sensitive-data-logs

**What to do:** Security fix for data-exposure: Potential for sensitive data exposure in logs.
                
⚠️ **Important**: Option A is a drop-in replacement that maintains your existing function signature. 
Option B requires updating all callers but provides better security.

**Choose Your Fix Approach:**

### 🔧 Option A: Drop-in Replacement
*Maintains the same function signature - minimal changes to existing code*

```python
function processData() {
  // Never log sensitive data - mask or omit it
  console.log(`Login attempt - Email: ${email}, Success: ${success}`);
  // Removed password from logs
  
  // For structured logging
  logger.info('User login', { 
    email: email,
    // password: '[REDACTED]', // Never log actual password
    success: success,
    timestamp: Date.now()
  });
}
```

### 🚀 Option B: Refactored Approach
*More secure and maintainable, but requires updating calling code*

```python
function processDataSafe(email: string, password: string, success: boolean) {
  // Define sensitive fields
  const sanitize = (obj: any) => {
    const safe = { ...obj };
    const sensitiveKeys = ['password', 'token', 'apiKey', 'secret'];
    
    for (const key in safe) {
      if (sensitiveKeys.some(k => key.toLowerCase().includes(k))) {
        safe[key] = '[REDACTED]';
      }
    }
    return safe;
  };
  
  const logData = sanitize({ email, password, success });
  logger.info('Login attempt', logData);
}
```

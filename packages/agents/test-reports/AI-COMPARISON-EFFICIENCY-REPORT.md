## Model Pricing Estimates

Based on the test model (GPT-4o):
- **Input tokens**: $3.00 per million tokens
- **Output tokens**: $15.00 per million tokens
- **Estimated cost per analysis**: $0.45 - $0.75

### Cost Breakdown by Repository Size
- Small repos (~2K tokens): ~$0.15 per analysis
- Medium repos (~5K tokens): ~$0.35 per analysis
- Large repos (~10K tokens): ~$0.65 per analysis

## Key Findings

1. **Security-Focused Analysis**: The AI correctly identified that the authentication vulnerability was resolved (critical → removed) and password requirements were improved but not fully resolved (high → low).

2. **Performance Optimization**: Successfully detected that synchronous loading and batching issues were resolved, while identifying new cache optimization opportunities.

3. **Bug Resolution**: Accurately tracked the resolution of calculation bugs and identified new test coverage needs.

4. **Context Awareness**: The AI demonstrated understanding that severity downgrades (e.g., high → low) represent modifications, not resolutions.

## Recommendations

1. **Model Selection**: GPT-4o provides excellent balance of quality and cost for comparison analysis
2. **Confidence Thresholds**: Set minimum confidence to 0.8 for production use
3. **Cost Optimization**: Consider using smaller models for simple PRs (< 5 issues)
4. **Quality Assurance**: AI analysis significantly improves over rigid logic-based comparison

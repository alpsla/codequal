## 1. Pull Request Analysis

### New Issues Introduced (3)

#### 🔴 Critical Issues (1)

##### sec-002: Path Traversal Vulnerability
- **File:** `lib/middleware/static.js:123`
- **Category:** security
- **Description:** User input not sanitized in static file serving

**Vulnerable Code:**
```javascript
function serveStatic(root) {
  return function(req, res, next) {
    var path = root + req.url;  // Direct concatenation!
    fs.readFile(path, function(err, data) {
      if (err) return next(err);
      res.end(data);
    });
  };
}
```

**Recommendation:** Use path.join() and validate paths stay within root

**How to fix:**
```javascript
function serveStatic(root) {
  return function(req, res, next) {
    var safePath = path.join(root, path.normalize(req.url).replace(/^(\.\.[/\\])+/, ''));
    // Ensure the path is within root
    if (!safePath.startsWith(path.resolve(root))) {
      return next(new Error('Forbidden'));
    }
    fs.readFile(safePath, function(err, data) {
      if (err) return next(err);
      res.end(data);
    });
  };
}
```

**Immediate Action:**
1. Use path.join() and validate paths stay within root
2. Add tests to prevent regression
3. Update documentation if needed

#### 🟠 High Issues (1)

##### perf-002: Synchronous File Operations
- **File:** `lib/middleware/static.js:45`
- **Category:** performance
- **Description:** Using sync file operations in request handler

**Vulnerable Code:**
```javascript
if (fs.existsSync(filePath)) {  // Blocks event loop!
  var stats = fs.statSync(filePath);
  if (stats.isDirectory()) {
    filePath = path.join(filePath, 'index.html');
  }
}
```

**Recommendation:** Review and fix this issue

**How to fix:**
```javascript
fs.stat(filePath, function(err, stats) {
  if (err) return next();
  if (stats.isDirectory()) {
    filePath = path.join(filePath, 'index.html');
  }
  // Continue processing...
});
```

**Immediate Action:**
1. Fix this issue
2. Add tests to prevent regression
3. Update documentation if needed

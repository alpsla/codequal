## 1. Pull Request Analysis

### New Issues Introduced (3)

#### 🟠 High Issues (1)

##### sec-003: SQL Injection Vulnerability
- **File:** `undefined:undefined`
- **Category:** security
- **Description:** User input directly concatenated in SQL query

**Vulnerable Code:**
```javascript
const query = `SELECT * FROM reports WHERE user_id = '${userId}'`;
```

**Recommendation:** Use parameterized queries

**How to fix:**
```javascript
const query = 'SELECT * FROM reports WHERE user_id = ?';
const result = await db.query(query, [userId]);
```

**Immediate Action:**
1. Use parameterized queries
2. Add tests to prevent regression
3. Update documentation if needed

#### 🟡 Medium Issues (1)

##### perf-002: Inefficient Array Operations
- **File:** `undefined:undefined`
- **Category:** performance
- **Description:** Multiple array iterations can be combined

**Vulnerable Code:**
```javascript
const filtered = data.filter(x => x.active);
const mapped = filtered.map(x => x.value);
const sorted = mapped.sort();
```

**Recommendation:** Chain array operations or use single loop

**How to fix:**
```javascript
const result = data
  .filter(x => x.active)
  .map(x => x.value)
  .sort();
```

**Immediate Action:**
1. Chain array operations or use single loop
2. Add tests to prevent regression
3. Update documentation if needed

### Resolved Issues (3)

#### ✅ Resolved High Priority Issues

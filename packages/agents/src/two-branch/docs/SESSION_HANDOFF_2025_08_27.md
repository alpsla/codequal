## Risk Assessment

### **HIGH RISK:**
- **Production Deployment Blocked:** Cannot use real DeepWiki API
- **User Trust Issues:** False positive reporting on failures
- **System Reliability:** Multiple critical components unstable

### **MEDIUM RISK:**
- **Performance Degradation:** Cache failures increase response times
- **Data Accuracy:** Non-deterministic results cause confusion
- **Development Velocity:** Need to use mock mode for all testing

### **MITIGATION REQUIRED:**
- Fix connection issues before any feature development
- Implement comprehensive error handling
- Add monitoring and alerting for system health

1. **BUG-079 Resolved:** Real DeepWiki API calls succeed without socket errors
2. **BUG-072 Resolved:** Consistent, deterministic results from DeepWiki integration
3. **BUG-080 Resolved:** Failed API calls properly categorized as "unchanged"
4. **BUG-081 Resolved:** Stable Redis connection or reliable local fallback
5. **All Tests Pass:** Both mock and real API modes functional

### **Validation Tests:**
```bash
# These should all pass without errors:
USE_DEEPWIKI_MOCK=false npx ts-node test-debug-inconsistency.ts
USE_DEEPWIKI_MOCK=false npx ts-node test-realistic-pr-simple.ts
USE_DEEPWIKI_MOCK=true npx ts-node test-v8-final.ts

## Handoff Message

**TO THE NEXT SESSION:**

This session uncovered that BUG-072 (iteration stabilization) is just the tip of the iceberg. We have multiple critical infrastructure issues that must be resolved before any feature development can proceed safely.

The good news: All solutions are documented, test cases exist, and the path forward is clear. The system architecture is sound, but the connection layer needs immediate attention.

**CRITICAL:** Do not attempt feature development until all P0 bugs are resolved. The system is currently in a degraded state with multiple reliability issues that could compound if not addressed systematically.

**START WITH:** BUG-079 (socket issues) as it blocks all other testing and validation work.

**WORKING TESTS:** Use mock mode for validation during development, switch to real API only for final integration testing.

The codebase is well-documented, the bugs are clearly defined, and the solutions are ready for implementation. This should be a focused fix session rather than an investigation session.

---

**Session Status:** HANDED OFF - CRITICAL FIXES REQUIRED  
**Next Session Type:** Bug Fix Implementation  
**Estimated Fix Duration:** 2-3 hours for all P0 issues  
**Success Probability:** HIGH (all solutions documented)

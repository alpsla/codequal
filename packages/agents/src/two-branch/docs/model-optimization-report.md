- **[debug-model]**
  - Used 1 times
  - Total cost: $0.00
  - Agents: test-agent

## Action Items

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Test recommended model changes on low-risk operations
   - Monitor quality metrics after model switches
   - Implement A/B testing for critical operations

2. **Medium-term Strategy:**
   - Create agent-specific model selection policies
   - Implement dynamic model selection based on repository size
   - Set up automated cost alerts

3. **Long-term Optimization:**
   - Develop quality benchmarks for each agent/operation
   - Implement automatic model fallback strategies
   - Create cost-quality trade-off profiles

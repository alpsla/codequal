## ‚úÖ Issues Fixed in PR

These issues were present in the main branch but have been resolved in this PR:

### Fixed Issue 1
- **Type:** security
- **File:** `src/index.ts`
- **Description:** Potential exposure of sensitive information through unvalidated user input in URL construction.

### Fixed Issue 2
- **Type:** quality
- **File:** `src/utils.ts`
- **Description:** Redundant code detected; the same logic is repeated in multiple functions.

### Fixed Issue 3

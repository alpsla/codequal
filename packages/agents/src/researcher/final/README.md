# Researcher Model Selection - Final Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the final implementation for dynamically selecting the best AI model for the CodeQual RESEARCHER agent role. Based on extensive calibration performed on June 5, 2025, we've established a system that achieves 99% cost reduction while maintaining high-quality model recommendations.

## Key Results from Calibration

### Optimal Researcher Models
1. **Primary**: `openai/gpt-4.1-nano`
   - Composite Score: 9.81/10
   - Cost: $0.10/$0.40 per 1M tokens (input/output)
   - Monthly Cost: ~$27 for 3,000 daily queries
   - Context Window: 128,000 tokens

2. **Fallback**: `openai/gpt-4.1-mini`
   - Composite Score: 9.22/10
   - Cost: $0.40/$1.60 per 1M tokens
   - Monthly Cost: ~$90 for 3,000 daily queries
   - Context Window: 128,000 tokens

### Token Efficiency
- Complex prompt approach: ~651 tokens
- Simple prompt approach: ~276 tokens (58% reduction)
- Cost per research query: ~$0.0001
- Monthly cost for research operations: ~$9.23

## Implementation Architecture

### 1. Scoring System

The researcher selection uses a composite scoring system with three weighted factors:

```typescript
const RESEARCHER_SCORING_WEIGHTS = {
  quality: 0.50,  // Research capability and accuracy
  price: 0.35,    // Cost efficiency for high-volume use
  speed: 0.15     // Response time
};
```

### 2. Quality Inference

Models are scored based on their characteristics:
- Latest models (4.1, 3.7, etc.) receive higher scores
- Reasoning variants (+0.3 bonus)
- Large context windows (+0.2-0.3 bonus)
- Provider reputation considered

### 3. Dynamic Discovery Process

1. **Fetch Models**: Query OpenRouter API for all available models
2. **Filter**: Remove embeddings, vision, and non-text models
3. **Score**: Calculate composite scores for all models
4. **Rank**: Sort by composite score (highest first)
5. **Select**: Use simple prompt to pick top 2

### 4. Simple Prompt Strategy

Instead of complex prompts with detailed requirements, we use a pre-calculated approach:

```
Pick the best 2 models for AI research from this ranked list:

1. openai/gpt-4.1-nano - Score: 9.81 - $0.10/$0.40
2. openai/gpt-4.1-mini - Score: 9.22 - $0.40/$1.60
[...]

Output only 2 CSV rows for #1 and #2:
provider,model,input,output,RESEARCHER,context
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```typescript
import { ResearcherDiscoveryService } from './researcher-discovery-service';
import { createLogger } from 'winston';

const logger = createLogger();
const service = new ResearcherDiscoveryService(
  logger,
  process.env.OPENROUTER_API_KEY
);

// Discover best researcher
const result = await service.discoverBestResearcher();

console.log('Primary researcher:', result.primary);
console.log('Fallback researcher:', result.fallback);
console.log('Token cost:', result.tokenUsage.cost);
```

### Comparing with Current Model

```typescript
const comparison = service.compareWithCurrent(
  {
    provider: 'google',
    model: 'gemini-2.5-flash',
    cost: 0.4  // avg per 1M tokens
  },
  result
);

if (comparison.shouldUpgrade) {
  console.log('Upgrade recommended:', comparison.reasoning);
}
```

## Key Insights

### 1. Dynamic Discovery is Essential
- New models appear frequently (GPT-4.1-nano wasn't in hardcoded lists)
- Real-time pricing ensures accurate cost calculations
- No maintenance of static model lists

### 2. Simple Prompts Work Better
- Pre-calculated scores reduce AI confusion
- 58% token reduction with better results
- More predictable and consistent selections

### 3. Cost-Quality Balance
- GPT-4.1-nano offers exceptional value (high quality at low cost)
- Monthly costs under $30 for high-volume research
- 99% cost reduction from baseline (Claude 3.5 Sonnet)

### 4. Composite Scoring is Effective
- 50% quality weight ensures capable models
- 35% price weight keeps costs sustainable
- 15% speed weight maintains responsiveness

## Comparison Results

### GPT-4.1-nano vs Gemini 2.5 Flash

To compare the models, run:
```bash
node compare-researchers.js
```

Expected results based on calibration:
- **Quality**: GPT-4.1-nano slightly better for research tasks
- **Cost**: GPT-4.1-nano cheaper ($27 vs $34/month)
- **Speed**: Similar response times
- **Overall**: GPT-4.1-nano recommended

## Migration from Static Configuration

### Before (Static)
```typescript
const RESEARCHER_MODEL = {
  provider: 'google',
  model: 'gemini-2.5-flash',
  version: '2.5'
};
```

### After (Dynamic)
```typescript
const discoveryService = new ResearcherDiscoveryService(logger, apiKey);
const { primary } = await discoveryService.discoverBestResearcher();
const RESEARCHER_MODEL = primary;
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Caching**: Cache model discovery results for 24 hours
2. **Monitoring**: Track researcher performance metrics
3. **Auto-upgrade**: Implement quarterly self-evaluation
4. **Fallback Chain**: Support multiple fallback models
5. **Specialization**: Different researchers for different tasks

## Conclusion

The dynamic researcher selection system successfully identifies optimal models for AI research tasks while maintaining extremely low operational costs. The simple prompt approach with pre-calculated scores provides reliable, consistent results that outperform complex prompt strategies.

# Comparison Agent

The Comparison Agent is a serverless AWS Lambda function that intelligently compares two DeepWiki analysis reports to determine what changed between branches. It replaces the previous 5 role-based agents with a single, more efficient comparison approach.

## Features

- **Intelligent Issue Matching**: Detects fixed, new, moved, and unchanged issues
- **Impact Analysis**: Calculates security, performance, quality impacts
- **PR Decision Making**: Determines if PR should be blocked based on critical issues
- **Code Movement Detection**: Tracks issues that moved due to refactoring
- **Fuzzy Matching**: Handles minor code changes using similarity algorithms

## Architecture

This agent is deployed as an AWS Lambda function with:
- API Gateway for HTTP endpoints
- CloudWatch for monitoring and alerts
- Serverless framework for deployment
- TypeScript for type safety
- Zod for runtime validation

### Final Report Components

The `final_report` section provides a comprehensive analysis including:

1. **Repository Analysis**: Complete state of the repository after PR
   - Total issue count with full details
   - Breakdown by severity and category
   - All issues with code snippets and recommendations
   - Overall repository score

2. **PR Impact**: Quantified impact of the changes
   - Number of issues fixed, introduced, and moved
   - Score change (positive = improvement)
   - Percentage improvement calculation

3. **Prioritized Issues**: All issues sorted by priority
   - Priority scoring algorithm considers severity, category, and status
   - New issues get bonus priority for immediate attention
   - Security issues receive additional weight

4. **Recommendations**: Actionable guidance
   - Category-specific recommendations
   - Priority levels (critical/high/medium/low)
   - Affected files for focused review

## Key Algorithms

### Issue Matching

The agent uses a multi-step approach to match issues:

1. **Exact Match**: Same ID, file, and line (Â±10 lines tolerance)
2. **Fuzzy Match**: Same ID with similar code (80%+ similarity)
3. **Movement Detection**: Identifies relocated issues

### Similarity Calculation

Uses Levenshtein distance algorithm to calculate code similarity:
- Normalizes whitespace
- Calculates edit distance
- Returns similarity ratio (0-1)

### Impact Scoring

- **Critical issues**: 10 points
- **High issues**: 5 points
- **Medium issues**: 2 points
- **Low issues**: 1 point

Positive impact for fixed issues, negative for new issues.

## Configuration

Environment variables:
- `REDIS_URL`: Redis cache connection string
- `LOG_LEVEL`: Logging level (info, debug, error)
- `NODE_ENV`: Environment (dev, prod)

## Health Check

```bash
GET /health
```

Returns service health status including memory usage and environment info.

## Performance

- Cold start: ~1-2 seconds
- Warm execution: <500ms for typical reports
- Memory usage: ~200MB for large reports
- Timeout: 30 seconds (configurable)

## Error Handling

- Invalid request format: Returns 400 with validation errors
- Internal errors: Returns 500 with error message
- All errors are logged to CloudWatch

## Cost Optimization

- Reserved concurrency prevents runaway costs
- Efficient memory allocation (1GB)
- Minimal dependencies for faster cold starts
- Tree-shaking removes unused code

## Advanced Scoring System

The Comparison Agent includes a sophisticated scoring system that tracks:

### Repository Scoring
- **Role-based priorities**: Security issues weighted 2x more than documentation
- **Issue aging**: Penalties increase daily (critical: -2/day, high: -1/day)
- **Improvement bonuses**: 50% bonus for fixing issues
- **Health status**: Ranges from 'critical' (<45) to 'excellent' (90+)

### Skill Tracking
- **Individual skill levels**: Tracks progress across 6 categories
- **Learning curve**: Beginners improve 1.5x faster
- **Milestone achievements**: "First critical fix", "Reached proficient level"
- **Personalized recommendations**: Based on skill gaps and recent issues

### Team Analytics
- **Skill gap identification**: Flags categories with average <60
- **Expert identification**: Users with 80+ skill levels
- **Balance recommendations**: Mentorship and training suggestions

### Scoring Configuration

```typescript
const scoringConfig = {
  severityScores: {
    critical: 40,
    high: 25,
    medium: 15,
    low: 5
  },
  roleMultipliers: {
    security: 2.0,      // Highest priority
    performance: 1.5,
    architecture: 1.3,
    dependencies: 1.2,
    quality: 1.0,
    documentation: 0.5  // Lowest priority
  },
  agingPenalty: {
    critical: 2.0,  // -2 points per day
    high: 1.0,      // -1 point per day
    medium: 0.5,    // -0.5 points per day
    low: 0.2        // -0.2 points per day
  }
};
```

## Database Integration

The scoring system integrates with Supabase tables:
- `repository_scores`: Historical score tracking
- `issue_tracking`: Issue aging and lifecycle
- `score_trends`: Daily/weekly/monthly trends
- `user_skills`: Current skill levels
- `user_skill_history`: Skill progression over time
- `team_skills`: Team-level aggregations
- `skill_milestones`: Achievement tracking

## Future Enhancements

- Machine learning for better issue matching
- Historical analysis trends
- Custom severity weightings
- Integration with notification systems
- Predictive scoring based on code patterns
- Automated skill-based code review assignment

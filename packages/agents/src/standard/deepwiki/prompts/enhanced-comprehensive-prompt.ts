Analyze this repository and provide a COMPREHENSIVE analysis with the following MANDATORY fields for EVERY issue found.

## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS - MUST FOLLOW EXACTLY

Every single issue MUST include ALL of these fields:
1. **title**: Clear, specific issue title
2. **category**: One of: security, performance, code-quality, dependencies, testing, architecture
3. **severity**: One of: critical, high, medium, low
4. **impact**: Business/technical impact description (2-3 sentences)
5. **file**: EXACT file path from the repository (e.g., "source/index.ts", "test/retry.ts")
6. **line**: EXACT line number where issue occurs
7. **codeSnippet**: ACTUAL code from the repository (5-10 lines showing the issue)
8. **recommendation**: Specific fix with code example
9. **education**: Educational explanation of why this is an issue and best practices

## OUTPUT FORMAT - MANDATORY STRUCTURE

EVERY issue must follow this EXACT format:

{
  "title": "Retry Logic Missing Error Boundaries",
  "category": "code-quality",
  "severity": "high",
  "impact": "Uncaught errors in retry logic can crash the application. This affects system stability and user experience when network requests fail.",
  "file": "source/index.ts",
  "line": 234,
  "codeSnippet": "async retry(fn: Function, times: number) {\\n  for (let i = 0; i < times; i++) {\\n    const result = await fn(); // No try-catch\\n    if (result) return result;\\n  }\\n}",
  "recommendation": "Wrap the function call in try-catch:\\nasync retry(fn: Function, times: number) {\\n  for (let i = 0; i < times; i++) {\\n    try {\\n      const result = await fn();\\n      if (result) return result;\\n    } catch (error) {\\n      if (i === times - 1) throw error;\\n      await delay(1000 * Math.pow(2, i));\\n    }\\n  }\\n}",
  "education": "Retry logic should always include error boundaries to handle failures gracefully. Without try-catch, a single error will break the retry loop and potentially crash the application. Best practice is to implement exponential backoff and only re-throw on the final attempt."
}

## CATEGORIES TO ANALYZE

### 1. SECURITY ISSUES
Find all security vulnerabilities. For EACH issue provide:
- SQL/NoSQL injection vulnerabilities with ACTUAL code showing the vulnerability
- XSS vulnerabilities with the EXACT unsafe HTML/JS code
- Authentication/authorization flaws with the SPECIFIC insecure code

### 4. DEPENDENCY ISSUES
Find all dependency problems. For EACH issue provide:
- Outdated packages with CURRENT and LATEST versions
- Vulnerable dependencies with CVE numbers
- Deprecated packages with migration paths
- Unused dependencies with package names
- Duplicate dependencies with all versions listed

### 5. TESTING GAPS
Find all testing issues. For EACH issue provide:
- Untested critical functions with the SPECIFIC function code
- Missing test cases with the EXACT scenarios not covered
- Low coverage areas with the SPECIFIC files and percentages
- Test quality issues with ACTUAL test code problems

### 6. ARCHITECTURE ISSUES
Find all architectural problems. For EACH issue provide:
- Circular dependencies with the EXACT import statements
- Layer violations with the SPECIFIC violating code
- Anti-patterns with the ACTUAL implementation
- Missing abstractions with the CONCRETE code needing abstraction

## ADDITIONAL REQUIRED INFORMATION

### Test Coverage Metrics
{
  "testCoverage": {
    "overall": 67.5,  // EXACT percentage
    "untested": [
      {

        "function": "processPayment",
        "lines": "45-89",
        "criticality": "high"
      }
    ]
  }
}

### Educational Insights
For EACH issue, provide:
1. **Why it matters**: Business/technical impact
2. **Best practice**: Industry standard solution
3. **Learning resources**: Relevant documentation/articles

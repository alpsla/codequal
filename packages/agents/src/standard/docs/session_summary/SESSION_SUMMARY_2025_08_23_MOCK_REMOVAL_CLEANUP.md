### 7. ‚úÖ Build Quality Assurance
**ESLint**: Fixed all 4 critical errors, 297 warnings remain (non-blocking)
**TypeScript**: All compilation successful, no type errors
**Build**: Complete build successful
**Tests**: Regression tests running successfully with real API

## üêõ Critical Issues Discovered

### Issue 1: Location Parsing Pipeline Broken
**Severity**: CRITICAL
**Description**: Real DeepWiki testing reveals locations become "unknown" in final reports
**Root Cause**: Transformation pipeline from DeepWiki ‚Üí ReportGenerator has bugs
**Next Session Priority**: #1

### Issue 2: 7 Duplicate Location Services (BUG-096)
**Severity**: HIGH  
**Description**: Multiple location services with overlapping functionality causing conflicts
**Impact**: Major contributor to location parsing failures
**Next Session Priority**: #2

### Issue 3: DeepWiki PR Analysis Limitation
**Severity**: HIGH (from previous session)
**Description**: DeepWiki analyzes entire repositories, not PR diffs
**Status**: Still unresolved, needs investigation

## üîÑ Git Commit Summary
Created 5 atomic commits with clear separation of concerns:

1. **e6f82a7**: `refactor: Remove all mock functionality from DeepWiki service`
2. **0f58684**: `chore: Archive 21 obsolete test and configuration files`  
3. **e76916a**: `feat: Add enhanced DeepWiki analysis services`
4. **e9a8b91**: `refactor: Update core components for real DeepWiki integration`
5. **8ec6b78**: `docs: Add comprehensive session documentation and bug tracking`

**Total Impact**: 27 files changed, 5,000+ lines modified

## üéØ Next Session Preparation

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Fix Location Parsing Pipeline** (CRITICAL)
   - Debug transformation pipeline from DeepWiki ‚Üí ReportGenerator
   - Test with real PRs in different languages
   - Validate issue types and severity mappings

2. **Clean Up Duplicate Location Services** (HIGH)  
   - Consolidate 7 location services into single implementation
   - Estimated 50% reduction in location-related bugs

3. **Test with Different PR Types** (HIGH)
   - Test large PRs, different languages, complex changes
   - Document which PR types work best

### Success Criteria for Next Session
- [ ] Location parsing pipeline working correctly
- [ ] BUG-096 resolved (duplicate services cleaned up)
- [ ] Reports show correct file locations (not "unknown")
- [ ] Issue types and severities display properly
- [ ] System tested with 3+ different programming languages

### Quick Start Commands
```bash
# 1. Start testing with real DeepWiki immediately
USE_DEEPWIKI_MOCK=false npx ts-node src/standard/tests/regression/manual-pr-validator.ts https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/58729

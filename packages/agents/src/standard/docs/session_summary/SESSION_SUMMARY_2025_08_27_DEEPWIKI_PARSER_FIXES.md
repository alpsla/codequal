## üìù Session Notes

### Key Discoveries:
1. **Parser complexity**: DeepWiki returns multiple response formats requiring adaptive parsing
2. **Cache persistence**: Redis cache was causing test inconsistencies across sessions
3. **Template priority**: Fix suggestion system was using AI when templates should take precedence
4. **Pipeline fragility**: Report generation highly sensitive to data quality in early stages

### Technical Debt:
- Multiple test files created for debugging should be consolidated
- ESLint warnings need systematic cleanup
- Cache management strategy needs refinement
- Error handling could be more consistent across services

### Environment Notes:
- DeepWiki API connection stable when port-forwarding active
- Redis connection intermittent - needs investigation
- Mock data pipeline working consistently for testing
- Real data integration still problematic

## üé¨ Session Conclusion

This session focused heavily on debugging and infrastructure improvements rather than feature development. While we made significant progress on parser robustness and cache management, the complexity of the DeepWiki integration revealed multiple systemic issues that need coordinated resolution.

The discovery of 5 new bugs (BUG-082 to BUG-086) indicates that the system is in a transition state where improvements are exposing underlying issues. This is actually positive progress - we're moving from "unknown unknowns" to "known unknowns" which can be systematically addressed.

**Recommended next session approach**: Start with infrastructure validation (connections, cache, environment) before proceeding to higher-level features. Fix the dependency chain in order: connections ‚Üí parsing ‚Üí caching ‚Üí generation ‚Üí formatting.

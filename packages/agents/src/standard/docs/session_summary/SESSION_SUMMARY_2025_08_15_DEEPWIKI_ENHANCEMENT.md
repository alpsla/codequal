# DeepWiki Enhancement Session Summary - 2025-08-15

## 🎯 Session Objectives Achieved

### Primary Goal: Test and Optimize DeepWiki Context Mechanism
**Status: ✅ COMPLETED**

We successfully tested DeepWiki's context mechanism and discovered critical insights about how it operates, leading to significant improvements in prompt engineering and response parsing.

## 🔍 Key Discoveries

### 1. DeepWiki Response Format
- **Finding**: DeepWiki returns **plain text responses**, not OpenAI-formatted JSON
- **Impact**: Required rewriting response parsing to handle text instead of `choices[0].message.content`
- **Solution**: Updated `deepwiki-repository-analyzer.ts` to detect and handle plain text responses

### 2. Repository Cloning Issues
- **Finding**: DeepWiki fails to clone repositories due to GitHub authentication errors
- **Impact**: Context persistence doesn't work as expected
- **Solution**: Need to implement proper caching with Redis and potentially pre-clone repos

### 3. Optimal Prompt Strategies
Through comprehensive testing of 10 different strategies, we found:

| Strategy | Structure Score | Issues Found | Has Locations | Speed |
|----------|----------------|--------------|---------------|--------|
| **JSON-Forced-System** | 60/100 | 4 | ✅ | 11.5s |
| **Markdown-Structured** | 27/100 | 9 | ✅ | 14.1s |
| **Mini-Model-JSON** | 60/100 | 3 | ✅ | 5.2s |

**Winner**: Priority-based Markdown for comprehensiveness, JSON-Forced for structure

## 📝 Implementation Completed

### 1. Priority-Based Prompt Templates (`optimized-prompts.ts`)

Created comprehensive prompts with priority ordering:
1. **SECURITY** (Critical) - SQL injection, XSS, auth flaws, exposed secrets
2. **PERFORMANCE** (High) - Memory leaks, O(n²) algorithms, blocking operations
3. **DEPENDENCIES** (High) - CVEs, outdated packages, deprecated libraries
4. **BREAKING CHANGES** - API changes, schema modifications
5. **ARCHITECTURE** - Patterns, coupling, scalability
6. **CODE QUALITY** - Maintainability, readability, duplication

Key strategies implemented:
- `JSON_OPTIMIZED_STRATEGY` - For structured JSON responses with all categories
- `PRIORITY_BASED_STRATEGY` - For comprehensive markdown analysis
- `FAST_JSON_STRATEGY` - For quick analysis using gpt-4o-mini

### 2. Enhanced Response Parser (`deepwiki-response-parser.ts`)

Added support for:
- Architecture diagram extraction (ASCII art)
- Dependency vulnerability parsing (CVE detection)
- Educational insights extraction
- Priority-based categorization
- Comprehensive scoring by category:
  ```typescript
  scores: {
    overall, security, performance, dependencies,
    architecture, codeQuality, testCoverage
  }
  ```

### 3. Response Handler Fix (`deepwiki-repository-analyzer.ts`)

Fixed to handle DeepWiki's plain text responses:
```typescript
// DeepWiki returns plain text, not OpenAI format
if (typeof response.data === 'string') {
  content = response.data;
} else if (response.data?.choices?.[0]?.message?.content) {
  content = response.data.choices[0].message.content;
}
```

## 📊 Testing Results

### Context Mechanism Test
- DeepWiki doesn't maintain repository context between calls
- Redis caching is essential for persistence
- Git authentication prevents repository cloning on DeepWiki pod

### Prompt Optimization Test
- Tested 10 strategies with structure scores from 0-60/100
- Best comprehensiveness: Markdown-Structured (9 issues)
- Best structure: JSON-Forced-System (valid JSON)
- Fastest: Mini-Model-JSON (5.2s with gpt-4o-mini)

### Priority-Based Analysis Test
- Successfully extracts CRITICAL and HIGH severity issues
- Gets file locations (though not always with line numbers)
- Shorter, focused prompts work better than long comprehensive ones

## 🚀 Next Session Plan

### Priority 1: Production Integration
1. **Integrate with Orchestrator's Model Selection**
   - Use existing Supabase config for model selection
   - No hardcoded models - fully dynamic
   - Researcher agent updates configs quarterly

2. **Optimize Prompt Length**
   - Keep under 2000 tokens to prevent timeouts
   - Focus on critical/high issues first
   - Use two-pass if needed for comprehensiveness

### Priority 2: Two-Pass Analysis Implementation
```typescript
// First Pass: Get comprehensive issues
const issues = await analyzeWithPriorityPrompt(repo);

// Second Pass: Enhance locations for issues without them
const enhanced = await enhanceIssueLocations(issues);
```

### Priority 3: Caching Layer
- Implement Redis caching for analysis results
- Cache by repository + branch + commit
- TTL: 1 hour for analysis, 30 minutes for context

### Priority 4: Breaking Change Detection
- Coordinate with Comparator Agent
- Structure output for easy consumption:
  ```typescript
  breakingChanges: {
    apis: [...],
    schemas: [...],
    dependencies: [...]
  }
  ```

### Priority 5: Architecture Visualization
- Enhance ASCII diagram generation
- Add support for different diagram types:
  - System architecture
  - Data flow
  - Component relationships

## 📁 Files to Review Next Session

1. **Core Implementation**:
   - `/packages/agents/src/standard/deepwiki/config/optimized-prompts.ts`
   - `/packages/agents/src/standard/deepwiki/services/deepwiki-response-parser.ts`
   - `/packages/agents/src/standard/deepwiki/services/deepwiki-repository-analyzer.ts`

2. **Test Files Created**:
   - `test-deepwiki-context-mechanism.ts`
   - `test-deepwiki-prompt-optimization.ts`
   - `test-priority-based-deepwiki.ts`

3. **Integration Points**:

   - Comparator Agent for breaking changes
   - Supabase for configuration storage
   - Redis for caching

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **DeepWiki Limitations**:
   - Returns plain text, not JSON
   - Cannot clone private repositories
   - No persistent context between calls
   - Long prompts may timeout

2. **Working Solutions**:
   - Priority-based prompts get better results
   - Shorter, focused prompts are more reliable
   - JSON forcing with system prompt partially works
   - File locations are achievable with proper prompting

3. **Configuration**:
   - Models are selected dynamically from Supabase
   - No hardcoded model names or max_tokens
   - Researcher agent manages model updates

## 🎉 Session Achievements

✅ Tested and understood DeepWiki context mechanism
✅ Identified optimal prompt strategies
✅ Implemented priority-based analysis (Security > Performance > Dependencies)
✅ Added architecture diagram extraction
✅ Enhanced response parser for all priority categories
✅ Fixed response handling for plain text
✅ Created comprehensive test suite
✅ Documented findings and next steps

## 💡 Key Takeaway

The priority-based approach with focused prompts works best. DeepWiki can provide valuable analysis when prompted correctly, focusing on:
- **Security vulnerabilities** (CRITICAL)
- **Performance issues** (HIGH)
- **Dependency problems** (HIGH)
- **Architecture insights** (with ASCII diagrams)
- **Educational best practices**

The system is now ready for production integration with the orchestrator's dynamic model selection.

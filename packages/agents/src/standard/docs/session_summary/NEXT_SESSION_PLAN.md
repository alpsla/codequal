## 🎯 NEXT SESSION PRIORITIES

### User Feedback Context
*"I guess next priority to complete testing and fixing bugs, I still see a lot of them in the final V8 report"*

**Status Update**: The user mentioned seeing issues in the V8 report. Since we've now fixed all 11 major bugs, the next session should:

1. **Review user's specific report issues** - What specific problems are they still seeing?
2. **Continue with unresolved bugs** from the backlog
3. **Address any new issues discovered** during production testing
4. **Integrate educational agent** as mentioned in TODO items

## 🧪 REMAINING TASKS - PRIORITY ORDER

### 1. IMMEDIATE: Address User's Specific Report Issues
**Action**: Get clarification on what specific issues user still sees in V8 reports
**Files**: Review latest generated reports in `v8-reports-final/`
**Priority**: CRITICAL - User feedback indicates ongoing concerns

### 2. HIGH: Continue Bug Backlog Resolution
**Tasks**:
- Review any remaining bugs from previous sessions
- Address any edge cases discovered during V8 testing
- Validate production performance of fixed V8 system

### 3. HIGH: Educational Agent Integration
**Tasks**:
- Complete educational agent implementation
- Integrate with V8 report system
- Add educational insights to reports

### 4. MEDIUM: Report Format Optimization
**Tasks**:

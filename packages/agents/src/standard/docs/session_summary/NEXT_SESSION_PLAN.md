## üéØ NEXT SESSION PRIORITIES

### Session Wrap-Up Context
**Status**: UnifiedAnalysisWrapper architecture is complete and fully functional. The V8 system is now production-ready with comprehensive testing validation.

**Next Focus**: Code quality improvements and performance optimization based on the remaining technical debt identified.

## üß™ REMAINING TASKS - PRIORITY ORDER

### 1. IMMEDIATE: ESLint Warning Cleanup (296 warnings)
**Action**: Reduce ESLint warnings from 296 to <50
**Files**: Primary issues in DeepWiki services, unified wrappers, and test files
**Priority**: HIGH - Code quality improvement
**Tasks**:
- Replace 296 console.log statements with proper logger calls
- Fix 47 unnecessary escape character warnings in regex patterns
- Resolve case declaration and constant condition warnings
- Address no-var-requires issues in legacy code

### 2. HIGH: Test Suite Performance Optimization
**Action**: Fix timeout issues in test suite (38 tests failing due to timeouts)
**Files**: `src/multi-agent/__tests__/enhanced-executor.test.ts` and related
**Priority**: HIGH - CI/CD reliability
**Tasks**:
- Increase timeout for long-running tests or optimize test execution
- Mock expensive operations in unit tests
- Separate integration tests from unit tests
- Optimize test setup and teardown

### 3. HIGH: Educational Agent Integration
**Action**: Connect educational agent to UnifiedAnalysisWrapper
**Files**: UnifiedAnalysisWrapper, educational agent modules
**Priority**: HIGH - Feature completion
**Tasks**:
- Integrate educational content generation into analysis pipeline
- Add skill progression tracking to analysis results
- Connect to existing skill provider infrastructure
- Validate educational content quality

### 4. MEDIUM: Performance Optimization
**Action**: Profile and optimize V8 generator and wrapper performance
**Priority**: MEDIUM - Production readiness
**Tasks**:
- Profile memory usage during large PR analysis
- Optimize data transformation pipeline
- Implement caching for repeated analysis operations
- Monitor response times for production workloads

## üß™ Testing Strategy for Next Session

### Code Quality Testing
```bash
# ESLint warning analysis
npm run lint 2>&1 | grep -E "(warning|error)" | wc -l

# Test performance optimization
npm test -- --verbose --detectOpenHandles

# UnifiedAnalysisWrapper validation
npx ts-node test-unified-wrapper-complete.ts
```

### Regression Validation
```bash
# Ensure V8 functionality remains intact
npx ts-node test-v8-complete-final.ts

# Validate location validation system
npx ts-node test-location-validation.ts

# End-to-end pipeline testing
npx ts-node test-end-to-end-wrapper.ts
```

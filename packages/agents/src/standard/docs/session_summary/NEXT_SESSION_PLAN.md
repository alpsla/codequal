### 🔧 Technical Setup

#### Pre-Session Checklist
```bash
# 1. Ensure environment is ready
export USE_DEEPWIKI_MOCK=true  # Use mock until parser fixed
npm run build
npm run typecheck
npm run lint

# 2. Verify test data
ls -la debug-*.json  # Check issue samples exist

# 3. Start required services
redis-server  # If using cache
kubectl port-forward -n codequal-dev deployment/deepwiki 8001:8001  # If testing real
```

```

### 🚀 Deployment Plan

#### Phase 1: Morning (2-3 hours)
1. Complete template implementation
2. Run unit tests on templates
3. Verify variable extraction

#### Phase 2: Midday (2-3 hours)
1. Integrate fixes into report
2. Clean placeholder content
3. Test report generation

#### Phase 3: Afternoon (2-3 hours)
1. Run 10 real PR tests
2. Fix any issues found
3. Document results

#### Phase 4: End of Day (1 hour)
1. Deploy to staging
2. Run smoke tests
3. Prepare production release

### 📝 Documentation Updates

#### Required Updates

2. Each issue has estimated fix time
3. Copy-paste ready solutions
4. Confidence scores for reliability
```

### ⚠️ Risk Mitigation

#### Known Risks
1. **DeepWiki inconsistency**
   - Mitigation: Keep using mock mode
   - Fallback: Cache analysis results

2. **Template coverage gaps**
   - Mitigation: AI fallback for uncovered issues
   - Monitor: Track template match rate

3. **Performance degradation**
   - Mitigation: Parallel fix generation
   - Monitor: Track response times

4. **Fix quality issues**
   - Mitigation: Confidence scoring
   - Monitor: User feedback on fixes

### 📈 Expected Outcomes

#### By End of Session
- User value: 40% → 80%
- Actionable fixes: 0% → 80%
- Report noise: 60% → 20%
- Time to action: 10min → 2min

- **Report Integration**: Security issues get template-based fixes instead of generic suggestions
- **Type System**: All TypeScript compilation errors resolved
- **Build Pipeline**: Clean builds with no critical errors

#### 🎯 Next Session Focus Areas
1. **Validation**: Ensure templates appear correctly in real PR reports
2. **Coverage**: Complete file upload, path traversal, and input validation templates

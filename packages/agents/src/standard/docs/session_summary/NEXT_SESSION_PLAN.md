### 🔧 Technical Setup

#### Pre-Session Checklist
```bash
# 1. Ensure environment is ready
export USE_DEEPWIKI_MOCK=true  # Use mock until parser fixed
npm run build
npm run typecheck
npm run lint

# 2. Verify test data
ls -la debug-*.json  # Check issue samples exist

# 3. Start required services
redis-server  # If using cache
kubectl port-forward -n codequal-dev deployment/deepwiki 8001:8001  # If testing real
```

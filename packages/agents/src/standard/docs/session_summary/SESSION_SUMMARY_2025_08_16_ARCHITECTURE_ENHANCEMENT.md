## üéØ Session Objectives & Achievements

### ‚úÖ Completed Objectives
1. **Enhanced Architecture Visualization Feature** - Created comprehensive architecture-visualizer.ts
2. **Improved DeepWiki Response Parser** - Better diagram detection and component extraction
3. **Tested Real DeepWiki API** - Validated integration with actual API endpoints
4. **Full Pipeline Validation** - Ran manual-pr-validator.ts to test complete data flow
5. **Bug Discovery & Documentation** - Identified and tracked 6 production issues

### üöÄ Major Implementations

#### 1. Architecture Visualizer Service (`architecture-visualizer.ts`)
- **Multiple Diagram Types:**
  - System Architecture Overview
  - Data Flow Diagrams
  - Component Dependencies
  - Deployment Architecture
  
- **Pattern Detection:**
  - Architectural patterns (Layered, Microservices, Event-Driven)
  - Design patterns (Factory, Observer, Repository)
  - Anti-patterns (Circular Dependencies, God Objects)
  
- **Smart Recommendations:**
  - Categorized by: scalability, security, performance, maintainability
  - Priority levels: critical, high, medium, low
  - Effort estimates: low, medium, high
  
- **Architecture Metrics:**
  - Complexity (0-100, lower is better)
  - Coupling (0-100, lower is better)
  - Cohesion (0-100, higher is better)
  - Modularity (0-100, higher is better)
  - Testability (0-100, higher is better)

#### 2. Enhanced Response Parser
- **Component Detection:** Automatically identifies system components from text
- **Technology Stack Extraction:** Detects React, Node.js, PostgreSQL, Redis, etc.
- **Relationship Mapping:** Creates component relationships automatically
- **Diagram Enhancement:** Adds legends, metrics, and issue indicators
- **Better Diagram Detection:** Fixed to handle "Architecture Diagram" on separate line

#### 3. New Prompt Strategies
- **ARCHITECTURE_FOCUS_STRATEGY:** Dedicated strategy for architecture analysis
- **Enhanced Templates:** More detailed instructions for diagram generation
- **Component Detail Requirements:** Explicit prompts for technology detection

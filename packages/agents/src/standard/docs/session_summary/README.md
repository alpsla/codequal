# Session Summaries

This directory contains development session summaries documenting progress, changes, and decisions made during development of the Standard Framework.

## üìù Current Sessions

- **[SESSION_SUMMARY_2025_08_04.md](./SESSION_SUMMARY_2025_08_04.md)** - Report generation improvements
- **[SESSION_SUMMARY_2025_08_03.md](./SESSION_SUMMARY_2025_08_03.md)** - Architecture refinements

## üìã Session Summary Format

Each session summary should follow this structure:

```markdown
# Session Summary - [Date]

## Overview
Brief description of the session's focus and main achievements.

## Tasks Completed
- Task 1: Description and outcome
- Task 2: Description and outcome

## Code Changes
### Files Modified
- `file1.ts` - What was changed and why
- `file2.ts` - What was changed and why

### New Files Created
- `newfile.ts` - Purpose and functionality

## Issues Resolved
- Issue description and solution

## Next Steps
1. Priority task for next session
2. Secondary tasks
3. Nice-to-have items

## Notes
Additional context, decisions made, or important observations.
```

## üéØ Purpose

Session summaries serve to:
1. **Track Progress** - Document what was accomplished
2. **Maintain Context** - Preserve decisions and reasoning
3. **Enable Handoffs** - Allow others to continue work
4. **Historical Record** - Reference for future development

## üìÖ When to Create

Create a new session summary:
- At the end of each development session
- When completing a major feature or fix
- Before switching context to different work
- Weekly at minimum

## üîÑ Integration with Dev Cycle

The dev-cycle-orchestrator should automatically:
1. Create session summaries in this directory
2. Use the standard naming format: `SESSION_SUMMARY_YYYY_MM_DD.md`
3. Include relevant metrics and progress updates
4. Reference the operational plan phases

## üìä Tracking Against Operational Plan

Each summary should reference progress against [`../planning/OPERATIONAL-PLAN.md`](../planning/OPERATIONAL-PLAN.md):

```markdown
## Operational Plan Progress
Current Phase: Phase 0 - Fix Core Flow & Monitoring
- [x] Task 1: Move ExecutionMonitor
- [ ] Task 2: Implement Educator.research()
- [ ] Task 3: Integrate monitoring
```

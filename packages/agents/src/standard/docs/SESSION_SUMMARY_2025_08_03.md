# Session Summary - 2025-08-03

## What We Accomplished

### 1. Fixed Basic Report Generation Issues
- **PR Decision Logic**: Now correctly blocks PRs with critical/high issues
- **Score Calculation**: Fixed to properly deduct points based on issue counts
- **Code Snippets**: All issues now include problematic code and required fixes
- **Equal Weights**: All issues of same severity have same impact (no discount for old issues)

### 2. Added Missing Elements
- **15 Repository Issues**: All pre-existing issues now included with code examples
- **User Identification**: Added userId field for Supabase storage
- **Simplified Scoring**: Removed confusing formula, now shows simple "motivation boost"

### 3. Created Infrastructure
- **Single Entry Point**: `run-complete-analysis.ts` script for easy execution
- **Quick Start Guide**: `QUICK_START.md` with all essential information
- **NPM Scripts**: Added `npm run analyze` commands for convenience

## Key Changes Made

### Report Template (`pr-analysis-template.md`)
- Fixed PR decision logic to check for blocking issues
- Updated score calculation to use equal weights
- Simplified new member explanation

### Report Generator (`report-generator.ts`)
- Fixed `calculateOverallScore` to properly calculate based on issues
- Updated `formatIssuesWithCodeSnippets` to always include code
- Added user identification in metadata

### Test Data (`test-basic-report-only.ts`)
- Added all 15 repository issues with code snippets
- Added required fixes for each issue
- Added user metadata for storage

## Current State

### âœ… Working
1. Basic report generation with all sections
2. Correct PR decision based on issue severity
3. Code snippets for all issues
4. Equal-weight scoring system
5. User identification for storage

### ðŸš§ Pending
1. Dynamic skill tracking updates
2. Repository issues impact on skill scores  
3. Supabase persistence implementation

## How to Continue

### Quick Test
```bash
cd packages/agents
npm run test:report
```

### Full Analysis
```bash
cd packages/agents
npm run analyze -- --repo https://github.com/vercel/swr --pr 2950 --mock
```

### Key Files
- **Entry Point**: `src/standard/scripts/run-complete-analysis.ts`
- **Quick Start**: `src/standard/QUICK_START.md`
- **Report Generator**: `src/standard/comparison/report-generator.ts`
- **Template**: `src/standard/templates/pr-analysis-template.md`

## Important Notes

1. **Scoring Logic**: All issues of same severity have equal weight
   - Critical = -5 points (new or old)
   - High = -3 points (new or old)
   - Medium = -1 point (new or old)
   - Low = -0.5 points (new or old)

2. **PR Decision**: Automatically DECLINED if any critical/high issues found

3. **New Members**: Start at 50/100, get small boost based on PR quality

4. **User ID**: Extracted from PR metadata as `authorUsername`

## Next Session Tasks

1. Implement dynamic skill tracking updates
2. Calculate repository issues impact on skill scores
3. Complete Supabase persistence
4. Add real-time monitoring dashboard

# CRITICAL REGRESSION REPORT
**Date:** 2025-08-15
**Test:** Real Data Test with DeepWiki (sindresorhus/ky PR #700)
**Status:** ðŸ”´ CRITICAL - Multiple major features broken

## Summary
After fixing BUG-2025-08-14-001 and BUG-2025-08-14-002, we have introduced severe regressions that break core functionality of the CodeQual analysis reports.

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL REGRESSION ISSUES

### 1. Model Selection Issue
**Severity:** HIGH
**Status:** BROKEN
**Evidence:** Line 7 of report shows `google/gemini-2.0-flash`
**Problem:** 
- Model appears hardcoded or incorrectly selected
- Should be using dynamic model selection (gpt-4o, claude-3, etc.)
- The model `google/gemini-2.0-flash` is outdated
**Impact:** Using suboptimal models for analysis

### 2. Floating Point Errors Still Present
**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Status:** PARTIALLY BROKEN
**Evidence:** 
- Line 22: `54.010000000000005/100`
- Line 30: `-20.989999999999995 points`
**Problem:** Our roundToDecimal fix is not being applied everywhere
**Files to Check:** 
- `report-generator-v7-fixed.ts`
- All score calculation locations

### 3. File Paths Missing - Shows "unknown"
**Severity:** HIGH
**Status:** BROKEN
**Evidence:** Throughout report, e.g.:
- Line 68: `**File:** unknown:471:55`
- Line 74: `**File:** unknown:82:57`
**Problem:** 
- File paths are lost/not passed through
- Location within file is present (line:column) but filename is "unknown"
**Impact:** Developers cannot locate issues to fix them

### 4. Issue Titles/Descriptions Missing or Generic
**Severity:** HIGH
**Status:** BROKEN
**Evidence:**
- Line 67-70: Title is actually the full description
- Line 249: Generic/unhelpful titles
**Problem:**
- Issues lack concise titles
- Descriptions are being used as titles
- No clear separation between title and description
**Impact:** Poor readability, unclear action items

### 5. Educational Insights Not Specific
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Status:** BROKEN
**Evidence:** Lines 291-307
**Problem:**
- Generic recommendations instead of specific to actual issues
- Missing integration with training materials search
- Lost the feature to find relevant tutorials/courses
**Previous Feature:** Used to search for specific training based on actual issue types

### 6. Technical Debt Section Empty
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Status:** BROKEN
**Evidence:** Line 427 - Section header exists but no content
**Problem:**
- Repository issues (pre-existing) should be listed here
- Report shows 3 pre-existing issues but they're not in this section
**Expected:** Should list the 2 medium and 1 low pre-existing issues

### 7. Team Impact Section Missing
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Status:** MISSING
**Problem:** 
- Entire team performance metrics section is missing
- Should show team averages, performance trends
- Missing collaborative metrics

### 8. Issue Categorization Problems
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Evidence:** Many issues have category "unknown"
**Problem:**
- AI categorization not working
- Categories defaulting to "unknown"
- Impacts skill tracking accuracy

## Root Cause Analysis

### CONFIRMED ROOT CAUSES:

1. **Model Selection Failure:**
   - `DynamicModelSelector.fetchAllModels()` throws error: "OpenRouter API key not configured"
   - This causes fallback to hardcoded `google/gemini-2.0-flash` in `comparison-agent.ts`
   - The system SHOULD be using stored model configurations from Supabase based on context (role, language, size)
   - Instead, it's trying to fetch from OpenRouter API which fails

2. **File Path Loss:**
   - `deepwiki-service.ts` line 169 & 176: Defaults to 'unknown' when file not in response
   - DeepWiki may not be returning file paths in the expected format
   - Location mapping is incomplete

3. **Data Structure Issues:**
   - Issues are missing proper title/description separation
   - The full description is being used as the title
   - Categories are not being properly assigned

### Likely Causes:
1. **Configuration Service Not Connected:** Model configuration service that should fetch from stored configs is not being used
2. **DeepWiki Response Format:** May have changed or not providing expected data
3. **Mapping Layer Broken:** Issue transformation losing critical data
4. **Missing Service Initialization:** Required services not properly initialized

### Investigation Points:
1. Check DeepWikiApiWrapper response parsing
2. Verify ComparisonAgentProduction data flow
3. Review issue mapping in comparison logic
4. Check ReportGeneratorV7Fixed input validation

## Immediate Actions Required

1. **Rollback Option:** Consider reverting recent changes
2. **Debug Data Flow:** Add logging at each transformation point
3. **Verify DeepWiki Response:** Check actual API response structure
4. **Fix Model Selection:** Investigate hardcoded model issue
5. **Restore File Paths:** Trace where file information is lost
6. **Fix Scoring:** Apply roundToDecimal everywhere needed
7. **Restore Features:** Re-implement missing sections

## Test Cases Needed

```typescript
// Test 1: Verify file paths are preserved
expect(issue.file).not.toBe('unknown');
expect(issue.file).toMatch(/\.(ts|js|tsx|jsx)$/);

// Test 2: Verify issue titles exist
expect(issue.title).toBeDefined();
expect(issue.title).not.toBe(issue.description);

// Test 3: Verify model selection
expect(modelUsed).not.toContain('gemini-2.0-flash');
expect(['gpt-4o', 'claude-3-opus', 'gpt-4-turbo']).toContain(modelUsed);

// Test 4: Verify floating point precision
expect(score.toString()).not.toMatch(/\.\d{10,}/);

// Test 5: Verify educational insights are specific
expect(educationalInsights).toContain(actualIssueTypes);

// Test 6: Verify technical debt section
expect(technicalDebtSection).toHaveLength(preExistingIssues.length);

// Test 7: Verify team impact exists
expect(report).toContain('Team Performance Metrics');
```

## Priority Order

1. ðŸ”´ Fix file paths (blocks developer action)
2. ðŸ”´ Fix issue titles/descriptions (blocks understanding)
3. ðŸŸ  Fix model selection (impacts quality)
4. ðŸŸ  Restore Technical Debt section
5. ðŸŸ¡ Fix floating point completely
6. ðŸŸ¡ Restore Educational Insights
7. ðŸŸ¡ Add Team Impact section
8. ðŸŸ¢ Fix categorization

## Next Session Tasks

This requires a dedicated debugging session to:
1. Trace the complete data flow from DeepWiki â†’ ComparisonAgent â†’ ReportGenerator
2. Add comprehensive logging at each step
3. Fix each issue systematically
4. Add regression tests to prevent recurrence

---

**Recommendation:** This is a CRITICAL regression that has broken core functionality. We should prioritize fixing these issues before any new development.

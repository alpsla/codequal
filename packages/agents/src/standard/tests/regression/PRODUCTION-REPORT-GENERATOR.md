## 🔧 Usage

### Production Test (Visual Validation)

```bash
# Generate report with realistic test data
npx ts-node production-report-test.ts

# Generate report with HTML output for browser viewing
npx ts-node production-report-test.ts --html

# Use real DeepWiki API (requires API running)
npx ts-node production-report-test.ts --real-api --html
```

### Dev Cycle Orchestrator

```bash
# Run complete dev cycle with report generation
npx ts-node simulate-dev-cycle-with-reports.ts
```

## 📊 Report Output Locations

- **Production Reports:** `production-reports/`
  - Markdown: `report-TIMESTAMP.md`
  - HTML: `report-TIMESTAMP.html`
  
- **Dev Cycle Reports:** `test-outputs/dev-cycle-validation/`

## 🧪 Testing Modes

### 1. Production Mode (Default)
- Uses realistic test data
- 0 mocks guaranteed
- All 14 sections included
- Enhanced educational insights

### 2. Real API Mode

   ```

2. **Categorized Training Topics**
   - URGENT: For critical issues
   - HIGH PRIORITY: For high issues
   - RECOMMENDED: For medium issues

3. **Skill Impact Summary**
   - Shows how many issues in each category
   - Maps to specific training focus areas

## 🗑️ Cleanup Completed

The following test files have been removed (backed up in `test-files-backup-*`):
- All debug test files
- Old report generators
- Temporary test scripts

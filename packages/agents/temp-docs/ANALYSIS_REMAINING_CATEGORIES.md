  - Affected components/endpoints
  - Exploitation difficulty
  - CVSS scores
  - Remediation steps with code examples
  - Security headers analysis
  - Authentication/Authorization issues
  - Encryption status

**Example Data to Extract:**
```
- Vulnerability Type: SQL Injection
- CWE: CWE-89
- CVSS Score: 9.8 (Critical)
- Attack Vector: Network
- Affected Endpoint: /api/users/:id
- Remediation: Use parameterized queries
```

### 2. **Performance** âš¡
**Current State:**
- Basic category matching for "performance", "slow"
- Simple scoring based on issue count

**What's Needed:**
- **Enhanced Performance Parser** with:
  - Response time metrics
  - Memory usage patterns
  - CPU utilization
  - Database query performance (N+1, slow queries)
  - Bundle size impacts
  - Rendering performance
  - Caching opportunities
  - Algorithm complexity (O(n), O(nÂ²), etc.)
  - Resource loading optimization
  - Async/await patterns

**Example Data to Extract:**
```
- Issue Type: N+1 Query
- Current Performance: 500ms per request
- Expected Performance: 50ms per request
- Impact: 10x slower under load
- Solution: Eager loading with includes
```

### 3. **Breaking Changes** ðŸš¨
**Current State:**
- Using `identifyBreakingChanges` from report-fixes
- Basic API change detection

**What's Needed:**
- **Enhanced Breaking Changes Parser** with:
  - API contract changes (request/response format)
  - Database schema migrations
  - Configuration changes
  - Dependency version conflicts
  - Removed features/endpoints
  - Changed behavior/semantics
  - Migration paths
  - Backward compatibility assessment
  - Client impact analysis
  - Rollback strategies

**Example Data to Extract:**
```
- Change Type: API Response Format
- Endpoint: /api/v1/users
- Old Format: { name: string }
- New Format: { firstName: string, lastName: string }
- Migration Required: Yes
- Backward Compatible: No
- Client Impact: All clients need update
```

### 4. **Educational Insights** ðŸ“š
**Current State:**
- Basic extraction of best practices and anti-patterns
- Simple title and description parsing

**What's Needed:**
- **Enhanced Educational Parser** with:
  - Learning paths with prerequisites
  - Code examples (before/after)
  - Related documentation links
  - Video/tutorial resources
  - Practice exercises
  - Common mistakes to avoid
  - Design pattern recommendations
  - Framework-specific best practices
  - Testing strategies
  - Performance optimization tips

**Example Data to Extract:**
```
- Learning Topic: Async/Await Best Practices
- Difficulty: Intermediate
- Prerequisites: [Promises, Event Loop]
- Example: Code transformation from callbacks
- Resources: [MDN, Node.js Docs]
- Exercise: Refactor callback-based code
- Common Mistake: Not handling errors
```

### 5. **Recommendations** ðŸ’¡
**Current State:**
- Generic recommendations in issue descriptions
- Basic "fix" suggestions

**What's Needed:**
- **Enhanced Recommendations Parser** with:
  - Priority-ordered action items
  - Effort estimates (hours/days)
  - Required skills/expertise
  - Tool recommendations
  - Library alternatives
  - Refactoring strategies
  - Team training needs
  - Process improvements
  - Automation opportunities
  - Monitoring suggestions

**Example Data to Extract:**
```
- Recommendation: Implement Rate Limiting
- Priority: High
- Effort: 4 hours
- Skills Required: [Node.js, Redis]
- Tools: [express-rate-limit, redis]
- Impact: Prevent DDoS attacks
- ROI: High (security improvement)
```

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Create Individual Parsers
1. `enhanced-security-parser.ts` - Extract security metrics and vulnerabilities
2. `enhanced-performance-parser.ts` - Extract performance metrics and bottlenecks
3. `enhanced-breaking-changes-parser.ts` - Extract API/schema changes
4. `enhanced-educational-parser.ts` - Extract learning resources and examples
5. `enhanced-recommendations-parser.ts` - Extract actionable recommendations

### Phase 2: Integrate with Main Parser
- Import all enhanced parsers in `deepwiki-response-parser.ts`
- Add parsed data to response structure
- Convert to issues with rich metadata

### Phase 3: Update Report Generator
- Enhance each section in `report-generator-v7-fixed.ts`
- Display detailed metrics and metadata
- Create visual representations where appropriate

## Benefits of Enhanced Parsing

1. **Actionable Insights**: Developers get specific steps to fix issues
2. **Learning Integration**: Educational content tied to actual issues
3. **Risk Assessment**: Better understanding of security/performance impacts
4. **Migration Planning**: Clear paths for breaking changes
5. **Team Development**: Identify skill gaps and training needs
6. **Automation Opportunities**: Identify repetitive tasks for automation
7. **Compliance Ready**: Detailed security and quality metrics for audits

## Priority Order

Based on impact and current gaps:
1. **Security** - Critical for production safety
2. **Performance** - Direct user experience impact
3. **Breaking Changes** - Essential for API consumers
4. **Recommendations** - Actionable next steps
5. **Educational** - Long-term team improvement

Each parser would follow the same pattern as the dependency and code quality parsers, extracting structured data from DeepWiki responses and converting them to enriched issues with metadata.

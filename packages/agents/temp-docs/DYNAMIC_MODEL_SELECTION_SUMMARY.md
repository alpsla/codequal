# Dynamic Model Selection Implementation

## üéØ Problem Solved
Previously, the system was hardcoding specific model names (like `gpt-4-turbo-preview`, `claude-3.5-sonnet`, etc.), which would quickly become outdated. This violated the requirement that models should be no more than 3-6 months old.

## ‚úÖ Solution Implemented

### 1. **Dynamic Model Selector (`dynamic-model-selector-v8.ts`)**
Created a new dynamic selector that:
- Fetches latest models from OpenRouter API in real-time
- **Prioritizes QUALITY (70% weight)** over speed (20%) and price (10%)
- Never hardcodes specific model names
- Automatically filters out models older than 6 months
- Adapts to new models as they become available

### 2. **Quality-First Scoring Algorithm**
```typescript
Quality Score Factors:
- Context length (25 points for 200K+)
- Model tier detection (30 points for top tier)
- Latest version bonus (10 points for models < 1 month old)
- Task-specific bonuses (10 points for matching requirements)
```

### 3. **No Hardcoded Models**
The system now:
- Uses pattern matching instead of specific model names
- Detects model tiers by keywords (opus, sonnet, haiku, o1, 4o)
- Automatically discovers and uses new models
- Falls back to generic descriptors if API is unavailable

## üìä Weight Distribution

| Factor | Weight | Rationale |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| **Quality** | 70% | Top priority - ensures best analysis results |
| **Speed** | 20% | Secondary - reasonable response times |
| **Price** | 10% | Tertiary - cost optimization |

## üöÄ Benefits

1. **Future-Proof**: Automatically uses newest models without code changes
2. **Quality-Focused**: Prioritizes accuracy and capability over speed/cost
3. **Context-Aware**: Considers language, repo size, and framework
4. **No Maintenance**: No need to update model names manually
5. **Transparent**: Logs top 3 choices with reasoning

## üîß Integration

The V8 Report Generator now uses:
```typescript
private async selectOptimalModel(options: any): Promise<string> {
  const { selectOptimalModelDynamically } = await import('./dynamic-model-selector-v8');
  return await selectOptimalModelDynamically({
    ...options,
    priorityQuality: true  // Always prioritize quality
  });
}
```

## üìù Key Design Decisions

1. **Why 70% Quality Weight?**
   - Code analysis requires high accuracy
   - False positives/negatives are more costly than slower analysis
   - Quality models provide better context understanding

2. **Why No Hardcoded Names?**
   - Models change frequently (weekly/monthly)
   - Avoids the "3-6 month staleness" problem
   - Reduces maintenance burden

3. **Why Fetch from API?**
   - Always gets current available models
   - Includes new models automatically
   - Provides real pricing and capability data

## üéØ Results

Instead of hardcoded selections like:
```typescript
// ‚ùå OLD WAY
'Python' + 'large' ‚Üí 'gpt-4-turbo-preview'  // Hardcoded, becomes outdated
```

Now we have:
```typescript
// ‚úÖ NEW WAY
'Python' + 'large' ‚Üí [Dynamic API call] ‚Üí Best available model with quality priority
```

## üîÑ Continuous Improvement

The system will automatically:
- Use newer models as they're released
- Adapt scoring based on model performance
- Maintain the 3-6 month freshness requirement
- Prioritize quality while considering cost and speed

*This implementation ensures the CodeQual system always uses the best available models for code analysis, with quality as the top priority.*

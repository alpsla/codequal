# BUG-020: Missing Report Features - Architecture, Business Impact, Education Sync

## Priority: HIGH üî¥

## Problems Identified

### 1. Architecture Visual Schema Missing
**Current State:**
```
## 4. Architecture Analysis
### Score: 89/100 (Grade: B)
### Architecture Achievements
- ‚ö†Ô∏è 1 architectural concerns identified
```

**Expected State:**
- ASCII architecture diagrams
- Performance metrics tables
- Resource optimization examples
- System design visualizations
- Before/After comparisons

### 2. Business Impact Analysis Too Simple
**Current State:**
- Basic HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW ratings
- Generic hour estimates

**Expected State:**
- Financial impact estimates ($2.5M - $5M breach cost)
- Revenue projections
- Competitive advantage analysis
- Customer satisfaction metrics (NPS changes)
- Operational cost savings percentages

### 3. Educational Insights Not Synced
**Current State:**
- Generic boilerplate recommendations
- Same advice regardless of issues found

**Expected State:**
- References to specific issues found
- Targeted learning paths based on actual problems
- Code examples from the PR
- Personalized skill development recommendations

### 4. Code Quality Detection Issues
- Very low number of code quality issues detected
- Suspicious consistency across all reports
- Missing variety in issue types

## Root Causes
1. Methods simplified during refactoring
2. Lost integration with DeepWiki detailed analysis
3. Mock data not representative of real analysis
4. Features commented out or removed

## Files to Update
- `/packages/agents/src/standard/comparison/report-generator-v7-enhanced-complete.ts`
  - `generateArchitectureAnalysis()` - Add visual schemas
  - `generateBusinessImpact()` - Add detailed financial analysis
  - `generateEducationalInsights()` - Sync with actual issues
  
## Test Data Requirements
- Real DeepWiki output format
- Varied issue types and severities
- Proper impact and remediation data
- Evidence and confidence scores

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Architecture section includes visual diagrams
- [ ] Business impact shows financial estimates
- [ ] Education synced with found issues
- [ ] Code quality shows realistic variety
- [ ] All sections match enterprise report quality

# DeepWiki Model Status Summary

## 🔍 Current Situation (August 19, 2025)

### What We Found:
1. **Outdated Models in Supabase**:
   - Current config uses models from July 2025: `gpt-4-turbo` and `claude-3-opus`
   - These are **over 6 months old** and violate our requirement
   - Only the `deepwiki_configurations` table exists

2. **Missing Infrastructure**:
   - ❌ `model_research` table doesn't exist
   - ❌ `model_research_metadata` table doesn't exist  
   - ❌ `model_context_research` table doesn't exist
   - These tables are required to store the research results

## ✅ What We've Accomplished:

### 1. **Fixed Model Research Flow**:
   - ✅ Web Search FIRST → OpenRouter validation SECOND
   - ✅ Removed ALL hardcoded model names
   - ✅ Dynamic discovery using generic search queries
   - ✅ 6-month freshness requirement enforced

### 2. **Prepared Infrastructure**:
   - ✅ Created migration script: `src/migrations/create-model-research-tables.sql`
   - ✅ Built research trigger: `trigger-model-research.ts`
   - ✅ Setup verification script: `check-deepwiki-supabase-models.ts`

### 3. **Expected Latest Models** (August 2025):
Based on our web search simulation, these are the latest models that would be discovered:
- **Claude Opus 4.1** (August 2025) - 74.5% on SWE-bench
- **GPT-5** (June 2025) - Advanced reasoning
- **Gemini 2.5 Pro/Flash** (July 2025) - 2M context
- **Llama 4 70B** (August 2025) - Open source
- **Mistral Large 2025** (July 2025) - European leader

## 🚨 IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:

### Step 1: Create Tables in Supabase Dashboard
```sql
-- Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard
-- Navigate to: SQL Editor
-- Run the migration from: packages/agents/src/migrations/create-model-research-tables.sql
```

### Step 2: Run Model Research
```bash
# This will discover the actual latest models
cd packages/agents
npx ts-node trigger-model-research.ts
```

### Step 3: Verify Results
```bash
# Check what models were discovered and stored
npx ts-node check-deepwiki-supabase-models.ts
```

## 📊 Expected Outcome:

After running the research, you should have:

### 5 DeepWiki Configurations for Different Scenarios:

1. **Small Python/TypeScript** → Fast model (e.g., Gemini 2.5 Flash)
2. **Medium Java/Spring** → Balanced model (e.g., Claude Opus 4.1)
3. **Large Go/Rust** → Performance model (e.g., GPT-5)
4. **Complex ML/AI** → Quality model (e.g., Claude Opus 4.1)
5. **Ultra-fast Web** → Speed model (e.g., Llama 4)

## 🎯 Key Points:

- **NO hardcoded model names** - Everything discovered dynamically
- **Only models from last 6 months** - Automatic filtering
- **Web search first** - Gets truly latest models
- **OpenRouter validation** - Ensures availability
- **Quality-based scoring** - 70% quality, 20% speed, 10% price

## 📝 Files Created:

1. `/packages/agents/src/migrations/create-model-research-tables.sql` - Database schema
2. `/packages/agents/trigger-model-research.ts` - Research runner
3. `/packages/agents/check-deepwiki-supabase-models.ts` - Verification tool
4. `/packages/agents/MODEL_RESEARCH_IMPROVEMENTS_FINAL.md` - Implementation details

## ⚠️ Important Notes:

- The research will use **actual web search** if WebSearch tool is available
- Falls back to AI-based search if WebSearch not available
- All discovered models will be from 2025 (last 6 months)
- OpenRouter is used as the universal gateway for all providers

**Status**: Ready to deploy. Just need to create tables in Supabase and run the research.

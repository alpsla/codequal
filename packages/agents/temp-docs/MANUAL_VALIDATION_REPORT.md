## 🔍 System Architecture & Data Flow

### 1. Overall System Flow
```
User Request
    ↓
DeepWiki API (Analyzes main & PR branches separately)
    ↓
ComparisonOrchestrator (Coordinates the flow)
    ├── LocationEnhancer (Adds file locations)
    ├── ComparisonAgent (Categorizes issues)
    │   ├── Resolved: Main only (fixed in PR)
    │   ├── New: PR only (introduced)
    │   └── Unchanged: Both branches (pre-existing)
    ├── EducatorAgent (Optional education)
    └── ReportGenerator (Creates final report)
    ↓
Final Report (Markdown/HTML/JSON)
```

### 2. Issue Categorization Logic
```typescript
// Clear categorization in ComparisonAgent:
- resolvedIssues:   Issues in main but NOT in PR (positive - fixed)
- newIssues:        Issues in PR but NOT in main (negative - introduced)
- unchangedIssues:  Issues in BOTH branches (neutral - pre-existing)
- modifiedIssues:   Issues that changed between branches
```

### 3. Report Display Logic
```typescript
// ReportGeneratorV7Fixed properly maps:
- New Issues → "PR Issues (BLOCKING)" section
- Unchanged Issues → "Existing Repository Issues (NOT BLOCKING)" section
- Resolved Issues → "Issues Resolved" section
```

## 📋 Fixed Issues Checklist

| Issue | Status | Fix Applied | Validation |
|-------|--------|------------|------------|
| 1. Scan duration < 0.1 seconds | ✅ Fixed | Pass `deepWikiScanDuration` to orchestrator | Shows 47s for real analysis |
| 2. Model showing wrong value | ✅ Fixed | Use proper model metadata from orchestrator | Shows "gpt-4o" correctly |
| 3. Floating point errors in scores | ✅ Fixed | Applied `.toFixed(1)` throughout | Clean decimal display |
| 4. Missing report sections | ✅ Fixed | Added all sections in ReportGeneratorV7Fixed | All sections present |
| 5. DeepWiki fallback analysis | ✅ Fixed | Removed fallback, added retry logic | Proper error handling |
| 6. Orchestrator bypass | ✅ Fixed | Updated to use ComparisonOrchestrator | Proper flow coordination |
| 7. Pre-existing issues showing as 0 | ✅ Fixed | Map unchangedIssues to existingIssues | Shows correct count |

## 🔄 Data Flow Documentation

### Critical Components:

#### 1. ComparisonAgent (`comparison-agent.ts`)
```typescript
/**
 * Issue Categories:
 * - resolvedIssues: Issues fixed in PR (main only)
 * - newIssues: Issues introduced in PR (PR only)  
 * - unchangedIssues: Pre-existing issues (both branches)
 * - modifiedIssues: Issues that changed severity
 */
```

#### 2. ReportGeneratorV7Fixed (`report-generator-v7-fixed.ts`)
```typescript
/**
 * Data Mapping:
 * - newIssues → PR Issues section (BLOCKING)
 * - unchangedIssues → Repository Issues section (NOT BLOCKING)
 * - resolvedIssues → Resolved Issues section (POSITIVE)
 */
```

#### 3. ComparisonOrchestrator (`comparison-orchestrator.ts`)
```typescript
/**
 * Coordination Flow:
 * 1. Get configuration (model selection)
 * 2. Enhance issues with locations
 * 3. Run comparison analysis
 * 4. Generate educational content
 * 5. Create final report
 */
```

## 🎯 Key Metrics & Performance

### System Performance:
- **Mock Mode Speed:** ~2 seconds
- **Real DeepWiki Speed:** ~47 seconds
- **Location Enhancement Success:** Variable (depends on repo structure)
- **Issue Matching Accuracy:** ~40% (limited by DeepWiki text variation)

### Report Quality:
- **Sections Generated:** 16/16 (100%)
- **Data Accuracy:** ✅ Verified
- **PR Decision Logic:** ✅ Working
- **Skill Tracking:** ✅ Integrated
- **Educational Content:** ✅ Available

---

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

### 1. DeepWiki Text Variation
- **Issue:** DeepWiki generates different descriptions for same issues
- **Impact:** Weak matching confidence (40-60%)
- **Mitigation:** Enhanced matcher with multiple strategies

### 2. File Location Detection
- **Issue:** Most issues show "unknown" location
- **Impact:** Limited navigation to source
- **Mitigation:** LocationEnhancer attempts AI-based detection

### 3. Issue Matching Precision
- **Issue:** Text-based matching has inherent limitations
- **Impact:** Some issues may be miscategorized
- **Mitigation:** Multiple matching strategies (title, severity, content)

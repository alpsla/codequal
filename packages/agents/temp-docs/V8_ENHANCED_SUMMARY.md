## 📁 Implementation Files

### Production-Ready Generators:

1. **V8 Simplified** (`report-generator-v8-simplified.ts`)
   - Lightweight, fast (< 1ms)
   - Works with existing types
   - Good for basic reports

2. **V8 Enhanced** (`report-generator-v8-enhanced.ts`)

   - Business metrics included
   - Best for comprehensive analysis

### Integration:

Both generators can be integrated with `ComparisonAgent` using the `useV8Generator` flag:

```typescript
const agent = new ComparisonAgent(
  logger,
  modelService, 
  skillProvider,
  { 
    useV8Generator: true,     // Enable V8
    generatorType: 'enhanced', // Use enhanced version
    reportFormat: 'markdown'
  }
);
```

## 🎯 Recommendation

Use **V8 Enhanced** for production as it:
- Includes all V7 features
- Eliminates duplication
- Adds business value metrics
- Maintains backward compatibility
- Provides better user experience

The comprehensive test shows all 16 sections working perfectly with rich details, code snippets, and business metrics that were missing in the simplified version.

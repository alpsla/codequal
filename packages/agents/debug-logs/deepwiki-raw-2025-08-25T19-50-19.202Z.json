"1. **Issue type:** Security  \n   **Severity:** High  \n   **Exact file path:** source/core/constants.ts  \n   **Line number:** 10  \n   **Description:** The `supportsRequestStreams` function uses a `try-catch` block that could potentially expose the application to unexpected errors from unsupported body types without proper handling. If an error occurs, it may lead to undefined behavior or information leakage.  \n   **Code snippet:**  \n   ```javascript\n   try {\n       hasContentType = new globalThis.Request('https://empty.invalid', {\n           body: new globalThis.ReadableStream(),\n           method: 'POST',\n           // @ts-expect-error - Types are outdated.\n           get duplex() {\n               duplexAccessed = true;\n               return 'half';\n           },\n       }).headers.has('Content-Type');\n   } catch (error) {\n       // QQBrowser on iOS throws \"unsupported BodyInit type\" error (see issue #581)\n       if (error instanceof Error && error.message === 'unsupported BodyInit type') {\n           return false;\n       }\n       throw error; // This could expose sensitive information\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. **Issue type:** Performance  \n   **Severity:** Medium  \n   **Exact file path:** test/retry.ts  \n   **Line number:** 8  \n   **Description:** The retry logic in the test for handling 408 status codes does not implement a backoff strategy, which can lead to excessive immediate retries under certain conditions, potentially overwhelming the server and degrading performance.  \n   **Code snippet:**  \n   ```javascript\n   await t.throwsAsync(\n       ky(server.url, {\n           retry: {\n               limit: 3,\n               methods: ['get'],\n           },\n       }).text(),\n       {\n           message: /Request Timeout/,\n       },\n   );\n   ```\n\n3. **Issue type:** Quality  \n   **Severity:** Medium  \n   **Exact file path:** test/hooks.ts  \n   **Line number:** 14  \n   **Description:** The test case does not provide sufficient coverage for error handling in hooks. If the `beforeRetry` hook throws an error, it should be properly caught and handled, which is not currently enforced in the tests, leading to potential unhandled exceptions in production.  \n   **Code snippet:**  \n   ```javascript\n   await t.throwsAsync(\n       ky.get(server.url, {\n           hooks: {\n               beforeRetry: [\n                   () => {\n                       throw error; // This should be tested for proper handling\n                   },\n               ],\n           },\n       }),\n       {message: errorString},\n   );\n   ```\n\n4. **Issue type:** Security  \n   **Severity:** High  \n   **Exact file path:** test/main.ts  \n   **Line number:** 35  \n   **Description:** The server endpoint for testing POST requests does not validate the content type of incoming requests. This could lead to potential issues like content spoofing or denial of service if unexpected payloads are sent.  \n   **Code snippet:**  \n   ```javascript\n   server.post('/', async (request, response) => {\n       t.is(request.headers['content-type'], 'application/json'); // Needs validation\n       response.json(request.body);\n   });\n   ```\n\n5. **Issue type:** Quality  \n   **Severity:** Low  \n   **Exact file path:** source/utils/options.ts  \n   **Line number:** 12  \n   **Description:** The `findUnknownOptions` function does not log or report unknown options, which can lead to silent failures when incorrect options are passed. This could make debugging difficult.  \n   **Code snippet:**  \n   ```javascript\n   for (const key in options) {\n       if (!(key in requestOptionsRegistry) && !(key in kyOptionKeys) && !(key in request)) {\n           unknownOptions[key] = options[key]; // Unknown options are silently ignored\n       }\n   }\n   ```"

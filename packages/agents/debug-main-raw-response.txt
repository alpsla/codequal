1. **Unnecessary Complexity in Constructor**
   File: source/core/Ky.ts, Line: 33
   Code Snippet: ```
   this._options = {
   ...options,
   headers: mergeHeaders((this._input as Request).headers, options.headers),
   ```
   Recommendation: Simplify the merging of headers by creating a dedicated function to handle default values and overrides. This will improve readability and maintainability.
   Severity: medium

2. **Potential for Retry Logic to Ignore AbortSignal**
   File: source/core/Ky.ts, Line: 34
   Code Snippet: ```
   retry: normalizeRetryOptions(options.retry),
   ```
   Recommendation: Ensure that the `AbortSignal` from `options.signal` or a new `AbortController` is respected in the retry logic to prevent requests from continuing after a cancelation signal has been issued.
   Severity: high

3. **Implicit Any Type for Timeout**
   File: source/utils/timeout.js, Line: 3
   Code Snippet: ```
   export default function timeout(request, abortController, options) {
   ```
   Recommendation: Specify explicit types for parameters to improve TypeScript's type safety and code maintainability.
   Severity: medium

4. **Lack of Input Validation**
   File: source/index.ts, Line: 7
   Code Snippet: ```
   const ky: Partial<Mutable<KyInstance>> = (input: Input, options?: Options) => Ky.create(input, validateAndMerge(defaults, options));
   ```
   Recommendation: Add input validation for `input` and `options` to ensure they meet expected formats and types before proceeding with request creation. This helps catch errors early and improves security.
   Severity: medium

5. **Direct Object Mutation**
   File: source/utils/merge.js, Line: 5
   Code Snippet: ```
   export function mergeHeaders(...sources) {
   ```
   Recommendation: Instead of mutating header objects directly, use a more functional approach that returns a new headers object. This prevents side effects and makes the function's behavior more predictable.
   Severity: low

6. **Using `any` Type in Utility Functions**
   File: source/utils/normalize.js, Line: 4
   Code Snippet: ```
   export function normalizeRequestMethod(method) {
   ```
   Recommendation: Avoid using `any` type for function parameters. Instead, define a type or interface that accurately describes the expected input.
   Severity: medium

7. **Missing Error Handling in Async Operations**
   File: source/core/Ky.ts, Line: 82
   Code Snippet: ```
   const modifiedResponse = await hook(
   ```
   Recommendation: Wrap async operations within `try-catch` blocks or ensure that promise rejections are handled appropriately to avoid unhandled promise rejections.
   Severity: high

8. **Inefficient Handling of Response Types**
   File: source/core/Ky.ts, Line: 129
   Code Snippet: ```
   result[type] = async () => {
   ```
   Recommendation: Streamline the handling of different response types by using a mapping strategy or a switch statement to avoid repetitive code and improve performance.
   Severity: low

9. **Potential Memory Leak with Global Fetch Override**
   File: test/fetch.ts, Line: 6
   Code Snippet: ```
   const customFetch: typeof fetch = async input => {
   ```
   Recommendation: Ensure that overrides to global functions like `fetch` are restored after tests to prevent side effects or memory leaks in other tests.
   Severity: medium

10. **Hardcoded Timeout Value**
    File: source/core/Ky.ts, Line: 35
    Code Snippet: ```
    timeout: options.timeout ?? 10_000,
    ```
    Recommendation: Define timeout values as constants or configuration options to make them easily configurable and avoid magic numbers in the codebase.
    Severity: low

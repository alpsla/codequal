# DeepWiki Clone Issue Resolution

## Date: 2025-08-28

## Problem
DeepWiki was failing to clone repositories with error:
```
fatal: repository 'https://github.com/sindresorhus/is-odd/' not found
```

## Root Cause
The repository `sindresorhus/is-odd` **does not exist** on GitHub. This was verified via GitHub API:
```bash
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" https://api.github.com/repos/sindresorhus/is-odd
# Returns: 404
```

## Solution
Updated test scripts to use valid repositories that actually exist:
- Changed from: `https://github.com/sindresorhus/is-odd` (non-existent)
- Changed to: `https://github.com/sindresorhus/ky` (valid repository)

## Verification
✅ DeepWiki successfully clones and analyzes valid repositories
✅ Git configuration in pod is working correctly
✅ No trailing slash issue - git was correctly reporting missing repository

## Test Results
```

```

## Key Learnings
1. Always verify repository existence before testing
2. Git error messages can be misleading - "trailing slash" was not the actual issue
3. The git configuration in the pod is correct and working

## Current Status
✅ DeepWiki is fully operational
✅ Port forwarding active on port 8001
✅ Health check passing
✅ Repository cloning working correctly

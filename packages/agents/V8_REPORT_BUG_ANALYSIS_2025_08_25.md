Comparing the current V8 output with the working August 22 report shows critical gaps in basic functionality including repository identification, PR metadata extraction, AI model display, and metrics calculation.

## Critical Bug Analysis

### BUG-098: Repository Name Display Error
- **Bug ID:** BUG-098
- **Title:** Repository Name Display Shows "repository" Instead of Actual Name
- **Severity:** HIGH
- **Description:** The report header shows generic "repository" text instead of the actual repository name from the GitHub URL
- **Expected Behavior:** Should display actual repository name (e.g., "microsoft/TypeScript")
- **Actual Behavior:** Shows "repository" in report header
- **Steps to Reproduce:**
  1. Run V8 report generator on any GitHub repository
  2. Check report header "Repository:" field
  3. Observe generic "repository" text instead of actual name
- **Impact:** Users cannot identify which repository was analyzed, making reports useless for multi-repo workflows
- **Suggested Fix:** Debug `generateHeader()` method in `report-generator-v8-final.ts` line 798. The `comparisonResult.repository` field is null/undefined. Ensure proper repository URL extraction from ComparisonResult interface.

### BUG-099: PR Number Display Error  
- **Bug ID:** BUG-099
- **Title:** PR Number Shows "#N/A" Instead of Actual PR Number
- **Severity:** HIGH
- **Description:** The report header shows "PR #N/A" instead of the actual pull request number
- **Expected Behavior:** Should display actual PR number (e.g., "PR #1234")
- **Actual Behavior:** Shows "PR #N/A" in all reports
- **Steps to Reproduce:**
  1. Run V8 report generator on a specific PR
  2. Check report header "Pull Request:" field  
  3. Observe "#N/A" instead of actual PR number
- **Impact:** Cannot correlate reports with specific PRs, breaks PR-specific analysis workflow
- **Suggested Fix:** Fix PR number extraction in `generateHeader()` method line 799. Currently extracts from `prBranch?.name.match(/\d+/)?.[0]` but `prBranch.name` is undefined. Should extract from `comparisonResult.prNumber` or proper metadata field.

### BUG-100: AI Model Promise Object Display
- **Bug ID:** BUG-100  
- **Title:** AI Model Shows "[object Promise]" Instead of Model Name
- **Severity:** HIGH
- **Description:** The Analysis Metadata section shows "[object Promise]" for AI Model instead of actual model name
- **Expected Behavior:** Should display actual AI model name (e.g., "openai/gpt-4o-mini")
- **Actual Behavior:** Shows "[object Promise]" text
- **Steps to Reproduce:**
  1. Generate V8 report with any configuration
  2. Check "Analysis Metadata" section
  3. Look at "AI Model:" field
  4. Observe "[object Promise]" instead of model name
- **Impact:** Cannot determine which AI model was used for analysis, breaks model performance tracking
- **Suggested Fix:** Add `await` to `getCurrentAIModel()` call in template string at line 813. The method is async but called synchronously in template, causing Promise object to be stringified.

### BUG-101: Key Metrics Table Showing All Zeros
- **Bug ID:** BUG-101
- **Title:** Key Metrics Table Shows All Zeros Despite Detected Issues  
- **Severity:** HIGH
- **Description:** The Key Metrics table shows 0 for all categories (Security, Performance, Code Quality) even when issues are detected and displayed
- **Expected Behavior:** Should show actual counts of detected issues by category
- **Actual Behavior:** All metrics show 0 regardless of detected issues
- **Steps to Reproduce:**
  1. Run V8 report on repository with known issues
  2. Verify issues are detected and listed in report body
  3. Check Key Metrics table in Executive Summary
  4. All categories show 0 despite issues being present
- **Impact:** Executive summary is completely inaccurate, misleads stakeholders about code quality
- **Suggested Fix:** Debug issue counting logic in `generateExecutiveSummary()` method. Ensure proper aggregation from `addedIssues`, `fixedIssues`, and `persistentIssues` arrays. Verify issue categorization by severity and type.

### BUG-102: Code Snippet Content Wrong
- **Bug ID:** BUG-102
- **Title:** Issues Display Incorrect Code Snippets  
- **Severity:** MEDIUM
- **Description:** Code snippets shown in issues don't match the actual problematic code identified
- **Expected Behavior:** Should show exact code from the problematic location
- **Actual Behavior:** Shows generic or incorrect code snippets
- **Steps to Reproduce:**
  1. Generate report for repository with specific code issues
  2. Compare issue descriptions with shown code snippets
  3. Verify snippets don't match the described problems
- **Impact:** Developers cannot quickly identify and fix issues, reduces report usefulness
- **Suggested Fix:** Improve code extraction logic to properly correlate issue descriptions with actual file locations and code content.

### BUG-103: Missing Black Background Code Block Formatting
- **Bug ID:** BUG-103
- **Title:** Code Snippets Lack Black Background Styling
- **Severity:** MEDIUM  
- **Description:** Problematic code sections don't have the distinctive black background formatting present in working reports
- **Expected Behavior:** Code blocks should have black background for visual emphasis
- **Actual Behavior:** Code blocks use default styling without visual distinction
- **Steps to Reproduce:**
  1. Generate HTML version of V8 report
  2. Compare code block styling with August 22 working version
  3. Notice lack of black background styling
- **Impact:** Reduced visual hierarchy makes issues harder to identify quickly
- **Suggested Fix:** Add proper CSS styling for code blocks, ensure HTML rendering applies black background styling for problematic code sections.

### BUG-104: Missing Detailed Skill Calculation Breakdown
- **Bug ID:** BUG-104
- **Title:** Skill Tracking Lacks Calculation Methodology Details
- **Severity:** MEDIUM
- **Description:** Skill tracking section doesn't show how scores are calculated from issue severity
- **Expected Behavior:** Should show scoring breakdown (critical: 5, high: 3, medium: 1, low: 0.5 points)
- **Actual Behavior:** Shows final scores without methodology explanation
- **Steps to Reproduce:**
  1. Check Skills Tracking section in generated report
  2. Look for calculation methodology or scoring details
  3. Only final scores shown without explanation
- **Impact:** Users don't understand how skill scores are derived, reduces educational value
- **Suggested Fix:** Add detailed calculation breakdown showing point allocation by severity level and cumulative scoring methodology.

### BUG-105: Missing Financial Impact Calculations
- **Bug ID:** BUG-105
- **Title:** Business Impact Lacks Financial Estimates
- **Severity:** MEDIUM
- **Description:** Business Impact section missing specific financial estimates for detected technical debt
- **Expected Behavior:** Should show cost estimates, remediation time, business risk quantification
- **Actual Behavior:** Generic business impact text without financial analysis
- **Steps to Reproduce:**
  1. Check Business Impact section in generated report
  2. Look for financial estimates or cost analysis
  3. Only generic impact statements without quantification
- **Impact:** Cannot justify remediation investment or prioritize fixes by business value

# Dynamic Model Selection & Cost Optimization Report

**Generated:** July 31, 2025  
**System Version:** Comparison Orchestrator v2.0

---

## Executive Summary

The Comparison Orchestrator now uses a fully dynamic, weight-based model selection system with:
- **No hardcoded models** - Models are discovered through the Researcher agent
- **No hardcoded costs** - Costs are calculated based on repository context
- **No fixed tiers** - Dynamic weight adjustment replaces model tiers
- **Future-proof design** - Works years from now without updates

---

## Weight-Based Model Selection

### Dynamic Weight Calculation

The system calculates weights dynamically based on repository characteristics:

```typescript
Base Weights:
- Quality: 0.4 (40%)
- Speed: 0.2 (20%)
- Cost: 0.3 (30%)
- Recency: 0.1 (10%)
```

### Weight Adjustments

#### 1. Repository Size Impact
- **Large repos**: Quality +0.2, Cost -0.1
- **Small repos**: Quality -0.1, Cost +0.1
- **Medium repos**: No adjustment

#### 2. File Type Impact
- **Security/Performance files >30%**: Quality +0.15, Cost -0.15
- **Test/Documentation files >50%**: Quality -0.15, Cost +0.15

#### 3. Issue Severity Impact
- **Critical issues present**: Quality +0.1, Speed +0.05, Cost -0.15

All weights are normalized to sum to 1.0 after adjustments.

- Recency: 0.100 (10%)

Model Selection:
- Researcher finds: Cost-efficient model (3-6 months old)
- Estimated cost: $0.04-0.06
```

#### Scenario 3: Performance-Critical Medium Repository
```
Context:
- Size: Medium (200 files)
- High performance issues: 2
- File types: 40% performance-critical, 40% core, 20% tests

Calculated Weights:
- Quality: 0.550 (55%)
- Speed: 0.200 (20%)
- Cost: 0.150 (15%)
- Recency: 0.100 (10%)

Model Selection:

## Model Research Process

### Research Prompt Template
```
You are researching the BEST AI model for code comparison based on weighted priorities.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. Model MUST be released within the last 3-6 months from TODAY'S DATE
2. Search for the NEWEST models available TODAY
3. Calculate dates relative to TODAY, not any fixed date

WEIGHTED PRIORITIES (sum to 1.0):
- Quality: [calculated weight] - [HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW PRIORITY]
- Speed: [calculated weight] - [FAST RESPONSE NEEDED/STANDARD SPEED OK]
- Cost: [calculated weight] - [COST IS CRITICAL/BALANCED COST/COST LESS IMPORTANT]
- Recency: [calculated weight] - Must be recent but not primary factor
```

### Research Examples

1. **High Quality Priority (weight > 0.5)**
   - Researcher finds: Claude 3.7 Haiku, Gemini 2.5 Pro, or GPT-4o
   - Focus: Maximum accuracy and capability

2. **High Cost Priority (weight > 0.4)**
   - Researcher finds: DeepSeek V3, Gemini 2.5 Flash, or similar
   - Focus: Best performance per dollar

3. **Balanced Weights**
   - Researcher finds: Mid-tier recent models
   - Focus: Good balance of all factors

## 1. Critical Security Fixes ✅

### 🔴→✅ SEC-001: JWT Tokens Never Expire (CRITICAL → RESOLVED)
- **File:** `src/auth/jwt.service.ts:234`
- **Vulnerability:** Tokens remained valid indefinitely
- **Fix Quality:** Excellent
```typescript
// Before (VULNERABLE)
const token = jwt.sign(payload, secret);

// After (SECURE)
const token = jwt.sign(payload, secret, { 
  expiresIn: '15m',
  issuer: 'payment-gateway',
  audience: 'api-clients'
});
```
- **Additional Security:** Refresh token rotation implemented
- **Compliance:** PCI-DSS requirement satisfied

### 🔴→✅ SEC-002: SQL Injection in User Search (CRITICAL → RESOLVED)
- **File:** `src/repositories/user.repository.ts:145`
- **Vulnerability:** Direct string concatenation in queries
- **Fix Quality:** Good
```typescript
// Before (VULNERABLE)
const query = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = '${email}'`;

// After (SECURE)
const query = 'SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = $1';
const result = await db.query(query, [email]);
```
- **ORM Migration:** Consider moving to TypeORM for better security

### 🔴→✅ SEC-003: Missing Admin Authentication (CRITICAL → RESOLVED)
- **File:** `src/routes/admin.routes.ts:23-45`
- **Vulnerability:** Admin endpoints exposed without auth
- **Fix Quality:** Excellent
```typescript
// Complete middleware stack now applied
router.use(authenticate);
router.use(requireRole('admin'));
router.use(auditLog);
router.use(rateLimiter({ max: 100, window: '15m' }));
```

---

## 2. Remaining Security Concerns

### 🟠 SEC-004: Weak Password Requirements (HIGH)
- **Status:** Partially addressed
- **Current:** Minimum 8 characters
- **Required:** 12+ chars, complexity rules
- **Compliance Gap:** NIST guidelines not met
- **Quick Fix:**
```typescript
const passwordSchema = z.string()
  .min(12)
  .regex(/^(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*\d)(?=.*[@$!%*?&])/);
```

---

## 3. New Issues Introduced ⚠️

### 🟡 SEC-007: Input Validation Gap (MEDIUM)
- **File:** `src/validators/payment.validator.ts:67`
- **Issue:** Card number validation too permissive
- **Risk:** Invalid data could reach payment processor
- **Fix Required:**
```typescript
// Add Luhn algorithm validation
export const validateCardNumber = (number: string): boolean => {
  const cleaned = number.replace(/\s/g, '');
  if (!/^\d{13,19}$/.test(cleaned)) return false;
  return luhnCheck(cleaned); // Implement Luhn
};
```

### 🟡 PERF-003: N+1 Query in Transaction History (MEDIUM)
- **File:** `src/services/transaction.service.ts:198`
- **Issue:** Loading user data in loop
- **Impact:** 500ms+ latency on large datasets
- **Fix:**
```typescript
// Use eager loading
const transactions = await Transaction.find({
  relations: ['user', 'merchant'],
  where: { status: 'completed' }
});
```

### 🟢 Low Severity Issues (3)
1. **Missing API rate limit headers** - Client visibility needed
2. **Incomplete error messages** - Stack traces in dev mode
3. **Outdated dependencies** - 2 packages with known CVEs

## 8. Deployment Considerations

### Breaking Changes
1. **JWT Format Changed** - Existing tokens will be invalid
2. **API Response Structure** - Error format standardized
3. **Rate Limits** - Now enforced (1000 req/hour)

### Migration Plan
```yaml
deployment:
  strategy: blue-green
  steps:
    - Deploy to staging
    - Run migration scripts
    - Invalidate all existing tokens
    - Monitor for 24h
    - Deploy to production with 10% canary
    - Full rollout after 48h monitoring
```

### Rollback Strategy
- Database migrations are reversible
- Feature flags for gradual rollout
- Previous version on standby for 72h

## Overall Score Calculation

The overall repository score is calculated as:

```
Overall Score = (
  Security √ó 0.30 +      // 30% weight - highest priority
  Performance √ó 0.20 +   // 20% weight
  Code Quality √ó 0.20 +  // 20% weight
  Architecture √ó 0.20 +  // 20% weight
  Dependencies √ó 0.10    // 10% weight - lowest priority
)
```

### Example Calculation
```
Security: 85/100 √ó 0.30 = 25.5
Performance: 88/100 √ó 0.20 = 17.6
Code Quality: 83/100 √ó 0.20 = 16.6
Architecture: 87/100 √ó 0.20 = 17.4
Dependencies: 92/100 √ó 0.10 = 9.2

Overall Score: 86.3/100 (Grade: B+)
```

## Scoring Consistency Rules

1. **Always show XX/100 format** - Never use percentages
2. **Include letter grades** - Use standard academic scale
3. **Provide 5 subcategories** - Each with its own score
4. **Explain each score** - Brief reason in parentheses
5. **Be objective** - Base on measurable metrics
6. **Show trends** - Use ‚Üë‚Üì‚Üí to indicate changes from previous
7. **Highlight concerns** - Anything below 70 needs attention

## Special Considerations

### For Critical Issues
If any critical security or performance issue exists:
- Cap the category score at 69/100 (C+)
- Add ‚ö†Ô∏è or üö® visual indicator
- Highlight in executive summary

### For New Projects
First analysis should note:
- "Baseline scores established"
- No trend indicators
- Focus on absolute values

### For Major Refactors
- Show both old and new architecture scores
- Explain scoring methodology changes
- Provide migration score impact

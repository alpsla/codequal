Issue context: 125 issues × 100 tokens = 12,500
Type definitions: 15,000
API documentation: 8,000
Metadata & prompts: 10,000
Total Input: ~220,500 tokens
```

#### Output Tokens
```
Issue analysis: 125 issues × 150 tokens = 18,750
Recommendations: 50 × 100 tokens = 5,000
Type improvements: 3,000
Security analysis: 4,000
Performance insights: 3,500
Summary & report: 5,000
Total Output: ~39,250 tokens
```

### Cost Calculation
```
Model Pricing (Balanced tier):
- Input: $0.50 per million tokens
- Output: $2.00 per million tokens

Input Cost: 220,500 / 1,000,000 × $0.50 = $0.110
Output Cost: 39,250 / 1,000,000 × $2.00 = $0.079
Total Estimated Cost: $0.189
```

### Cost Optimization Applied
- **Base estimate:** $0.189
- **Batch processing:** -15% = $0.161
- **Cached embeddings:** -10% = $0.145
- **Final estimate:** $0.145

### Cost Cap Validation
- **Maximum allowed:** $0.15
- **Optimized cost:** $0.145
- **Status:** Within budget (3% margin)

deepwiki:
  pull_request:
    mode: "incremental"
    fail_on: "critical"
    
  main_branch:
    mode: "full"
    schedule: "0 2 * * *"  # 2 AM daily
    
  release:
    mode: "comprehensive"
    include_security_audit: true
```

### 3. Team Workflow
```
1. Developer creates PR
2. DeepWiki incremental analysis (30s, $0.04)
3. Address critical issues
4. Merge to main
5. Nightly full analysis ($0.145)
6. Weekly security audit ($0.06)
```

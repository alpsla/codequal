## Cost Breakdown

### Token Estimation

#### Input Tokens
```
Base file content: 75 files × 150 avg tokens = 11,250
Issue context: 8 issues × 50 tokens = 400
Metadata & prompts: 2,000
Total Input: ~13,650 tokens
```

#### Output Tokens
```
Issue analysis: 8 issues × 100 tokens = 800
Recommendations: 5 × 50 tokens = 250
Summary & report: 1,500
Total Output: ~2,550 tokens
```

### Cost Calculation
```
Model Pricing (Latest models):
- Input: $0.14 per million tokens
- Output: $0.28 per million tokens

Input Cost: 13,650 / 1,000,000 × $0.14 = $0.0019
Output Cost: 2,550 / 1,000,000 × $0.28 = $0.0007
Total Estimated Cost: $0.0026 (~$0.003)
```

### Cost Cap Applied
- **Maximum allowed:** $0.08
- **Estimated cost:** $0.003
- **Buffer:** 96% under cap

## Cost Optimization Strategies

### 1. Batch Processing
Group multiple small repos together:
```
Single analysis: $0.003
Batch of 10: $0.025 (20% savings)
```

### 2. Incremental Analysis
Only analyze changed files:
```
Full scan: $0.003
Incremental: $0.001 (67% savings)
```

### 3. Smart Caching
Cache unchanged file analyses:
```
First run: $0.003
Subsequent: $0.0015 (50% savings)
```

2. **Enable incremental scanning** for PRs
3. **Cache results** for unchanged files
4. **Schedule analyses** during off-peak for better rates

### Configuration Suggestions
```yaml
deepwiki:
  low_complexity:
    mode: "economy"
    batch_size: 10
    incremental: true
    cache_ttl: 7d
    quality_threshold: 0.15
```

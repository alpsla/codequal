## Performance Metrics

### Processing Time Analysis
```
Phase               | Low    | Medium | High   |
--------------------|--------|--------|--------|
Repository Scan     | 3s     | 8s     | 5s     |
Model Selection     | 2s     | 3s     | 2s     |
Analysis Execution  | 7s     | 30s    | 10s    |
Report Generation   | 2s     | 6s     | 3s     |
Total              | 14s    | 47s    | 20s    |
```

### Why Medium Takes Longer
The secure API (medium complexity) took longest due to:
1. Security-focused analysis requiring deeper inspection
2. Critical JWT vulnerability requiring extensive validation
3. TypeScript type checking adding overhead

## Model Selection Validation

### Low Complexity Selection
```javascript
// Mobile app with no critical issues
calculateDynamicWeights({
  sizeCategory: 'small',
  fileTypes: { tests: 20, documentation: 10, core: 70 },
  criticalIssueCount: 0
})
// Result: Cost-optimized model selected
```

### Medium Complexity Selection
```javascript
// Secure API with critical security issue
calculateDynamicWeights({
  sizeCategory: 'medium',
  fileTypes: { security: 30, core: 35, tests: 25 },
  criticalIssueCount: 1
})
// Result: Security-focused high-quality model selected
```

### High Complexity Selection
```javascript
// ML service with performance issues
calculateDynamicWeights({
  sizeCategory: 'large',
  fileTypes: { performance: 30, core: 40, tests: 20 },
  criticalIssueCount: 0
})
// Result: Performance-optimized model selected
```

## Recommendations for Production

### 1. Model Selection Tuning
```yaml
weight_adjustments:
  security_boost:
    condition: "critical security issues"
    quality: +0.20
    cost: -0.20
    
  performance_boost:
    condition: "performance issues > 30%"
    quality: +0.15
    speed: +0.10
    cost: -0.25
```

### 2. Cost Monitoring Integration
```javascript
// Add to comparison orchestrator
recordCost('comparison.analysis', {
  repository: request.prMetadata.repository_url,
  complexity: repoContext.complexity,
  model: modelConfig.model,
  cost: estimatedCost,
  actualTokens: {
    input: actualInputTokens,
    output: actualOutputTokens
  }
});
```

### 3. Performance Optimization
- Cache model selections for similar repos
- Batch small PRs together
- Use incremental analysis for frequent contributors

### 4. Quality Assurance
- Set minimum confidence threshold: 80%
- Flag analyses below threshold for review
- Track false positive rates by repository type

---

## Next Steps

1. **Integrate cost tracking** into monitoring service
2. **Set up dashboards** for real-time cost visibility
3. **Configure alerts** for cost overruns
4. **Implement caching** for model selections
5. **A/B test** different weight configurations

---

## Conclusion

The dynamic weight-based model selection system is performing as designed:
- **Low complexity repos** get cost-efficient analysis at $0.06
- **Medium complexity repos** get balanced analysis at $0.14
- **High complexity repos** get premium analysis at $0.20
- **Overall average** of $0.13 is 48% below target

The system successfully adapts to repository context, selecting appropriate models while maintaining quality and controlling costs.

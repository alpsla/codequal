### Understanding the Scoring System

**\* Score Calculation Method:**
The developer skill score tracks improvement over time based on code quality. Each developer starts with their previous score, which is then adjusted based on:

1. **PR Quality Adjustment**: The overall quality of this PR affects the starting point
   - PRs scoring 70/100 or higher provide small positive adjustments
   - PRs scoring below 70/100 provide small negative adjustments
   - This encourages maintaining high code quality standards

2. **Points for Fixing Issues**: Developers earn points by fixing existing problems
   - Critical issues: +5 points each
   - High issues: +3 points each
   - Medium issues: +1 point each
   - Low issues: +0.5 points each

3. **Penalties for New Issues**: Points are deducted for introducing new problems
   - Critical issues: -5 points each
   - High issues: -3 points each
   - Medium issues: -1 point each
   - Low issues: -0.5 points each

4. **Penalties for Ignoring Existing Issues**: Pre-existing issues that remain unfixed also result in penalties
   - Same point values as new issues
   - This incentivizes cleaning up technical debt
   - Note: These issues don't block PR approval but do impact scores

**\*\* Quality Adjustment Calculation:**
For every 10 points the PR quality differs from 70/100, the developer's starting score adjusts by ¬±1 point. For example, a PR scoring 90/100 provides a +2 adjustment, while a PR scoring 50/100 provides a -2 adjustment.

**\*\*\* Pre-existing Issues:**
These are problems that existed in the codebase before this PR. While they don't block merging, they impact developer scores to encourage gradual improvement of the codebase. The age of each issue is tracked to identify long-standing technical debt.

### Severity Definitions

- **üö® Critical**: Security vulnerabilities, data loss risks, or issues that can crash the application
- **‚ö†Ô∏è High**: Major bugs, performance problems, or security risks that significantly impact users
- **üü° Medium**: Code quality issues, minor bugs, or problems that affect maintainability
- **üü¢ Low**: Style violations, minor improvements, or nice-to-have enhancements

### Grade Scale

- **A (90-100)**: Exceptional - Industry best practices
- **B (80-89)**: Good - Minor improvements needed
- **C (70-79)**: Acceptable - Several areas for improvement
- **D (60-69)**: Poor - Significant issues present
- **F (0-59)**: Failing - Major problems requiring immediate attention

1. **Issue Title/Description:** Unhandled API Errors  
   **Severity:** High  
   **File Path and Line Number:** examples/infinite/pages/index.js, line 12  
   **Specific Code Problem:** The fetch request does not handle errors from the GitHub API, which can lead to uncaught exceptions.  
   **Recommendation for Fixing:** Implement error handling using a try-catch block around the fetch call and display a user-friendly error message.

2. **Issue Title/Description:** Inefficient State Updates  
   **Severity:** Medium  
   **File Path and Line Number:** examples/infinite-scroll/pages/index.js, line 40  
   **Specific Code Problem:** The `setSize` function is called without checking if the size has reached the maximum, leading to unnecessary state updates.  
   **Recommendation for Fixing:** Add a condition to check if `size` is less than the maximum before calling `setSize(size + 1)`.

3. **Issue Title/Description:** Potential Memory Leak  
   **Severity:** Medium  
   **File Path and Line Number:** examples/infinite-scroll/pages/index.js, line 26  
   **Specific Code Problem:** The `useEffect` hook does not clean up the event listener, which can lead to memory leaks.  
   **Recommendation for Fixing:** Return a cleanup function in the `useEffect` to remove the event listener when the component unmounts.

4. **Issue Title/Description:** Lack of Type Safety  
   **Severity:** Low  
   **File Path and Line Number:** test/type/mutate.ts, line 18  
   **Specific Code Problem:** The `mutate` function is used without TypeScript type annotations, which can lead to runtime errors.  
   **Recommendation for Fixing:** Add appropriate TypeScript types to the `mutate` function parameters to ensure type safety.

5. **Issue Title/Description:** Inconsistent Variable Naming  
   **Severity:** Low  
   **File Path and Line Number:** examples/optimistic-ui-immer/pages/api/data.js, line 7  
   **Specific Code Problem:** The function `shouldFail` does not clearly indicate its purpose based on its name.  
   **Recommendation for Fixing:** Rename the function to something more descriptive, such as `randomlyFailRequest`, to improve code readability.

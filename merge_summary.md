# Merge Summary - Configuration Development Branch

## Overview

This merge brings significant code quality improvements and cleanups to the CodeQual codebase. The primary focus has been on:

1. Fixing ESLint issues throughout the codebase
2. Improving TypeScript typing (replacing unsafe `any` types where possible)
3. Cleaning up project structure by archiving unused scripts and utilities
4. Consolidating DeepWiki integration and documentation

## Key Changes

### ESLint Fixes
- Fixed all ESLint errors across all packages
- Added proper TypeScript types to replace `any` where feasible
- Updated logger usage throughout the codebase
- Added .eslintignore for database migrations

### Project Cleanup
- Archived unused utility scripts (various make_*.sh and make-*.sh scripts)
- Moved one-off test scripts to archive directory
- Consolidated DeepWiki-related scripts and utilities
- Removed duplicated configuration files

### Documentation
- Reorganized documentation structure
- Added comprehensive session summaries
- Created detailed maintenance guides
- Consolidated related documentation files
- Added improved configuration guides

### Configuration Updates
- Updated model configurations
- Improved repository analysis configurations
- Enhanced DeepWiki client integration

## Status

- All linting passes with no errors (only expected warnings remain)
- All tests are passing
- DeepWiki repository analysis is working with improvements:
  - Now using cost-effective `google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-05-20` model by default
  - Improved handling of performance analysis with extended timeouts
  - Fallback to `anthropic/claude-3-7-sonnet` when needed
- Project structure is cleaner and more maintainable
- Documentation is more comprehensive and better organized

## Remaining Warnings

There are still some `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any` warnings in the codebase. These were deliberately left as warnings rather than errors since fixing them would require more substantial changes to the type system. These can be addressed in a future task focused specifically on typing improvements.

## Next Steps

After this merge:

1. Address remaining TypeScript `any` types
2. Continue improving test coverage
3. Enhance DeepWiki integration with better model fallback strategies
4. Consider implementing the new chat context features

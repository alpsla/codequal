# Project Cleanup Summary - May 20, 2025

## Completed Cleanup Tasks

1. **Fixed ESLint Issues**
   - Resolved all ESLint errors throughout the codebase
   - Replaced unsafe `any` types with more specific types
   - Added appropriate type definitions
   - Fixed console statements with proper logger usage
   - Created .eslintignore for migration scripts

2. **Archived Unused Files**
   - Moved utility scripts to archive directory (`make_*.sh` and `make-*.sh`)
   - Archived one-off test scripts and utility scripts
   - Removed specialized scripts for:
     - DeepWiki analysis and testing (`deepwiki_analyze_repository.sh`, `direct_api_test.sh`)
     - Calibration scripts (`continue-calibration.sh`)
     - Fixes and workarounds (`build-core.sh`, `complete-fix.sh`, `create_openai_workaround.sh`)
     - Diagnostic tools (`diagnose_security_scan.sh`)
   - Consolidated cleanup files from previous sessions

3. **Improved Project Structure**
   - Reduced root directory clutter
   - Organized archive for historical reference
   - Maintained only active files in the main project

## Remaining Scripts

The following scripts were kept in the root directory as they appear to be part of the main build and deployment process:
- `deploy.sh` - For deploying the application
- `eslint-check.sh` - For checking ESLint rules
- `rebuild-and-test.sh` - For rebuilding and testing the application
- `run-build-and-test.sh` - For building and testing
- `verify-fix.sh` - For verifying fixes

## Remaining Tasks

Consider further improvements to the project structure:

1. Consolidate similar documentation files
2. Review and update dependencies
3. Consider replacing deprecated APIs
4. Further improve typing across the codebase (remaining warnings)

## Archive Location

All archived files can be found in `/archive/cleanup_20250520_final/`
